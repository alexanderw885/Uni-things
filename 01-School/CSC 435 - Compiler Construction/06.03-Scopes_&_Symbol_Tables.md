Depending on where you are, the meaning of A, B, or C might be different due to scope. At P1, we bound A to a float, blocking the pre-existing binding to an int. This is called *shadowing*. Some languages have ways to let you access shadowed variables.
At P2, the float is out of scope, so A is an int again.

### Symbol Table
in a program, a name is bound to it's meaning. A variable is bound to it's datatype, and a function signature is bound to its function.
In many languages like C or Java, this binding in static. In Python or JavaScript, binding is dynamic.

This binding of ID to a memory address is in the symbol table.
- with static binding, the table is used and maintained by the *compiler*
- with dynamic binding, the table is used and maintained during *run-time*.
The table also has some information about the name
- is it a class, field, or variable?
- what data type is it?

In object-oriented languages, it's impossible to complete the symbol table in one pass. For example:

Here, by line 3, the compiler knows that there is an object type `B`, and nothing else

Typically for OO languages, there's three passes:
1. top-level symbol table for names of datatypes declared or imported
2. analyze the body of each class to fill in details in the symbol table. List the fields and methods of each class
3. check the body of each method. This uses the symbol table to track formal parameters and local variables.

#### Top-level Symbol Table
for OO languages, the symbol table is often tree-structured, with lots of smaller tables pointing to each other.
Interestingly, this tree is often traversed upward:

If we want the find the meaning of V1, we start at the table for our current black, and traverse up the tree until we find the identifier meaning.

#### Simple imperative symbol table
the symbol table consists of name/information pairs. It could even be a stack of pairs.
On these symbol tables, there's some standard operations:
- `empty`: create an empty symbol table
- `define` or `bind`: add a new name/information binding pair at the current scope level, pushing it to the top of the stack
- `resolve` or `lookup`: find most recent binding for a name, going from the top of the stack down
- `enter`: push a scope marker onto the stack
- `exit`: pop items from the stack *until* the next scope marker.
`enter` and `exit` are very important for scope. With them, we can enter and leave scopes.
There can also be a check when using `define` to make sure we don't add two of the same name in the same scope.

Another method, instead of pushing scope markers onto the stack, is to have a second scope stack. when using `enter`, you push the value of the current top of the stack pointer into the scope stack. When you `exit`, pop from the system stack until the pointer matches the top value of the scope stack.
#### Other data structures
This table can be very large, a linear search isn't practical. The original Pascal compiler used binary trees, though most compilers not use *hash tables*

There's still `define`, `resolve`, `enter`, and `exit`, though they of course have to be implemented differently.
There are two approaches:
- Keep the  scope stack and systack, but augment them with a hash function. This makes it easier to enter and exit, you can do it the same as with simple stacks.
- Drop the stack entirely. Now each entry has a "level" value, that we use instead of a scope stack. When you enter, you increase your level, and all entries created will have that level. When you exit, decrement your level and delete all entries with higher levels.
The problem with approach one is that you still need to re-hash the names of all variables to be deleted on exit.
The main problem with approach two is that deleting items when exiting is expensive.

In approach number one, stack with a hash table, what do we do if the stack overflows? If it's implemented as an array, the most reasonable option is to reallocate the array, doubling its size. You could also chain multiple arrays together, but that's slower and error-prone.
#### Imperative and persistent symbol tables
with an imperative, or destructive approach, entries are deleted at scope exit. This is usually fine, but it's a problem if those entries needed to be access again over multiple passes of the program.

hash tables
a persistent symbol table will never delete any entries. Viewed as a tree, each entrance to a higher scope creates a new node on the tree:
