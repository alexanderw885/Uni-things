The [AST](05.30-Abstract_Syntax_Trees) lends itself very will to evaluation via interpretation.
We make an interpreter as a collection of recursive functions, one for each type of construct (one for a statement, a block, a function, ...).

Interpretation is relatively straight-forwards to do, but it is usually 10 - 1000 times slower than compiled code.
It's also very good for monitoring the execution of programs.

There are a few ways to increase speed of interpreted languages:
- static type checking, so you don't have to keep checking as the code runs
- using threaded code
- using a non-tree format
along with others.
