The back end of a compiler is often very complex, and very messy. This is because architectures can be very complex and messy.
The dream code is to generate the "best" code, but this is an NP-complete problem. Instead, we have to settle for always trying to make "better" code.

One way of analysing [IR code](06.25-Intermediate_Code_Generation) to produce a better result than direct translation is **liveness analysis**.
**Definition**: A variable is live at some program point if it's value might be used at some point in the future. It's dead if there is no way for its value to be used in the future.

To determine if variable V is live at program point P, we have to check all possible control flow paths from P to check if any of them have an exposed use of V **before V's value is redefined**. We can't always know, we run up against the halting problem.

**Important ideas**: 
- If two variables are never live at the same time, they can share a register or space in memory.
- if a variable is dead right after assignment, we can remove the assignment entirely (Dead Code removal)
- if an uninitialized variable is live, there might be a control-flow path that uses the uninitialized variable. This can be used for error detection

This analysis is always going to be conservative. If a variable might be used, or we don't know, the variable *may* be live and we have to treat it is if it *is* live.

### Intuitive approach
We proceed backwards through the code; start at the bottom, at which point everything is dead, and work our way up. If we reach an assignment, then **in this order**:
1. the LHS is marked as dead
2. each RHS variable is marked as live
we do this at the program point immediately before the assignment.

#### Basic blocks
a basic block is the longest sequence with entirely linear control flow. The effects of basic blocks can be pre-analysed  with Gen and Kill sets:
- Gen\[b\]: all variables used in the block b before any assignments
- Kill\[b\]: all variables that are assigned a new value in the block b
A variable can be in both gen(b) and kill(b)
We also want IN(b) and OUT(b):
- IN(b): all live variables at the entry to block b
- OUT(b): all live variables at the exit to block b

How these sets are related:

OUT\[b\] is the union of all IN sets of blocks that b might lead to.

**Example:**

| Block | Gen         | Kill        | ~Kill      |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 1     | $\emptyset$ | {i}         | {J,X,T1}   |
| 2     | {I}         | {J}         | {I,X,T1}   |
| 3     | {J,X}       | {T1,X}      | {I,J}      |
| 4     | {J}         | {X,I}       | {J, T1}    |
| 5     | {I}         | $\emptyset$ | {I,J,X,T1} |
| 6     | {X}         | $\emptyset$ | {I,J,X,T1} |
Now we can start the creation of IN and OUT. I'm going to drop the curly braces, but they should still be there.
Since in depends on out, and out depends on in, we con't compute both all at once. We start by adding gen\[b\] to each IN set, and build it out from there.

| Block | IN          | OUT |
| ----- | ----------- | --- |
| 1     | $\emptyset$ |     |
| 2     | I           |     |
| 3     | J,X         |     |
| 4     | J           |     |
| 5     | I           |     |
| 6     | X           |     |
Now we can start OUT

| Block | IN          | OUT         |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1     | $\emptyset$ | I           |
| 2     | I           | J,X         |
| 3     | J,X         | I           |
| 4     | J           | I           |
| 5     | I           | X,I         |
| 6     | X           | $\emptyset$ |
Now that we've started out, we can add more to IN. Specifically, the intersection of ~Kill and OUT

| Block | IN          | OUT         |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1     | $\emptyset$ | I           |
| 2     | I,X         | J,X         |
| 3     | I,J,X       | I           |
| 4     | J           | I           |
| 5     | I,X         | X,I         |
| 6     | X           | $\emptyset$ |
Now we have more IN values, so we can add to OUT. We repeat this until further iteration leads to no new changes.

| Block | IN    | OUT         |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| 1     | J,X   | I,J,X       |
| 2     | I,J,X | I,J,X       |
| 3     | I,J,X | I,X         |
| 4     | J     | I,X         |
| 5     | I,J,X | I,J,X       |
| 6     | X     | $\emptyset$ |
Note that T1 isn't in any IN or OUT sets, it's contained entirely in the one block.
