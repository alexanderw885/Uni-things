Compared to parsing and AST construction, this is much less elegant.

### Types of Typing
**Strong typing**
	when an operation can only be applied with the correct datatypes. The compiler guarantees that if an operation proceeds, it has the correct datatype.
**Weak typing**
	when it's up to the programmer to ensure operands have the correct type. One language can have both string and weak typing in different areas
**dynamic typing**
	checks for operand datatypes are performed at runtime
**Static typing**
	checks for operand types are performed at compile time. Goes with strong typing.

while weak vs. strong typing is a choice made by the language's developer, dynamic vs. static is a choice of the language's implementer. This means that type checking can be static with one interpreter, and dynamic in the other.
