covered briefly in [CSC330](01.15-Syntax_Semantics), grammars are a formal mechanism to associate semantic actions with grammar rules.

Attributes can be synthesized or inherited
**Synthesized**
	data that's propagated upwards from the leaf nodes. A node gets synthesized attributes from its children.
**Inherited**
	data that's propagated downwards from the root.
	A node gets inherited attributes from either its parent *or* it's siblings.

### Synthesized Attributes Example
let's look at this `yacc` code, it's the grammar for a calculator:

Here's the same attribute grammar, but in a more standard notation:

In both of these, all attributes are synthesized. We get the attributes from the leaf nodes, the numbers.
### Inherited Attributes Example
Now, the left hand side of a rule has attributes that modify the right hand side. Or, the parents modify the attributes of children. Our example is writing numbers in different bases. Our goal is to return the number in base 10.

It's grammar is written as:
![[Pasted image 20250611130116.png]]
each number has the attributes `base` and `val`. 

Let's go through a specific example, `3AB#16`
![[Pasted image 20250611130652.png]]
Goal has the attribute answer, this is inherited
Number has the attributes base and value
Digits have the attribute value
We'll want to determine all attributes for every node in this tree.

- First, we can fill in the value attribute for all the digits.
- We can also assign the rightmost `number` under `goal` the base 10. 
- That base can be inherited by the number above `1`.
- Next, we can use rule 2, `number.val=digit.val` to get the values for all numbers with only one digit. However, we cannot perform the assert, as we don't have the base

What order to we evaluate these attributes in general? We could pass over the tree repeatedly until there's no change, but that's expensive. A good solution is non-trivial.
we want to figure out:
- how many passes?
- are they left-right, right-left, or something else?
We can use these to categorize grammars.

Everything we did earlier with `yacc` is left-right, or it uses L-attributed grammars.
