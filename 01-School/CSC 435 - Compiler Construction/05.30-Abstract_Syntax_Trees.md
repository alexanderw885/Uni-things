it would be good to review [extended Backus-Naur Form](01.15-Syntax_Semantics)
let's look at a full parse tree:

it's *very* verbose. there's a lot of information that's important for the construction of the tree, but that doesn't help us at all after. We can construct an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) out of it, stripping it down to only what's necessary

All of the vertices that didn't contain any important info are gone, even the parenthesis are removed, as precedence is shown in the tree itself.

When implementing the AST, there's a number of things to keep in mind.
- it can have large numbers of nodes, possible even in the millions, though not in this class. It needs to be fast and efficient.
- Traversing the AST is the same as traversing a regular tree. It can be expensive, so it's good to do as much as possible in each pass. 
- Each node contains semantic information.

**The Visitor Pattern**
there is an abstract visitor class, and each type of traversal is implemented as a visitor. Each node will have a generic accept method for the visitor class.
