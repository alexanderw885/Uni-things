Four things to keep in mind to a strong paragraph:
### Unity
start with topic sentence.
Whole paragraph is **unified** around that idea
that means avoid unrelated details

### Order
you can order supporting sentences in a few ways
- chronology
- importance
- logic: order that makes most sense
random sentences can cause confusion, so order helps the reader follow along

### Coherence
use transition words to connect sentences
- words to show order
- words for spatial relations
- words to show logical order

### Completeness
- topic sentence: main point or idea
- supporting sentences: evidence, examples, analysis to develop main idea
- concluding sentences: summarize main idea, and maybe link to main idea
