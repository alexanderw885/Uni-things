could be good to have an option for more detail "click to know more/if you're a scientist"
- 2 levels of technicality, we don't need to write them ourselves

good features
- game-ification
- social media integration
- feedback method
- maybe a "What is ONC?" section
- use data API to update information in real-time

can we involve the community?
- you can suggest it!
- things like narrators, or surveys on what they want to see in display
- you can suggest they do a survey, don't design the survey

things that were / were not successful before?
- do NOT dive too deep, we are not making the whole thing ourselves
- do look into ways to increase engagement
- do basic research on ways to power, do NOT go too far. You  can suggest simple things loke solar, with "here's a weather map, here's how it relates"
- how does it get a connection? suggest cable/wifi, explain why
- do basic comparative research
- "generally, displays do X"
- if outside, do look into weather conditions

budget?
- not yet
- Campbell river cost 500k, but we do not have a budget yet

what level of maintenance?
- should be possible to update it with new information/if things change or go down. remote could be cool
- They have had wifi problems, had some cable problems too
- Vandalism can be a concern
- ocean/salt spray have ruined a screen, keep in mind if on a pier
- may partner with community/group for maintenance


what size?
- if there has been research done to increase engagement
- "other displays do X"

purpose?
- complete overview of ocean ecosystem
- increase ocean literacy
- aim to help people understand the environment, why it matter, who uses it

ages?
- all ages
- family, children, elderly, anything in between


design for tourists or locals?
- talking point, you decide
- should be designed around location, but being transferrable could be a talking point


accessibility difficulties in the past?
- wheelchair has been hard, accounting for all different heights
- colour is difficult, hard to keep it accessible to everyone

what changes after installation of other displays? cultural/environmental
- presenter does not know yet, will get back to us

cleanliness concerns?
- partnership with aquarium at Campbell river, they clean it
- "might be good to add community ties to help with this"
- should be kept clean if possible

general constraints
- local regulations and laws, do NOT deep dive. "if X, consider Y"
