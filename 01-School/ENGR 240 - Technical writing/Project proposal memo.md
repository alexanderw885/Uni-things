memo to convince coordinator to put you on a team for an proposal
You are part of an engineering firm asked my the coordinator to write this memo.
be persuasive, state your purpose and explain it 

add two references, probably the RFP and some research into the company
	CAN and probably will be ONC resources
not fully formed solutions, rough ideas, preliminary solutions
show you know what it takes to look into/study this topic
Should include:
	 your choice of observatories
	 inside or outside
	 tech to study further
	 social aspect
	 either environmental, regulatory, or economic aspect
Be persuasive!!! be professional! but that's less cool, so it gets emphasized less be me.
follow memo format, Ch. 7.1

this will be long-ish for a memo, 600-800 words. use headings, and good formatting
use at least one list, use at least one figure or label
will go over IEEE, so use it. less important for memo, mostly for proposal

Give experience and/or explain skills to help say why *you* should do this
can fictionalize a little bit, but within reason

Post draft in discussion forum by Friday 9th, that's 1 week from today
