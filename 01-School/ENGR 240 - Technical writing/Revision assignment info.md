watch out for be-verbs as main verbs.
try to avoid be, is, are, they make writing sound weak. Use active verbs instead

be careful with "there" and "it"
they can be vague in what they reference, and add to the word count
you can use them, but don't *over*use them

avoid passive voice sentences
less was, less past tense, be clear and specific.
