Classical systems are either substitution ciphers or transposition ciphers.

Substitution:
- Replace characters or groups of characters with different characters/groups.
- in a monoalphabetic cipher, for the whole message each character is mapped to a unique corresponding character.
- in a polyalphabetic cipher, the corresponding characters may change. 
Transposition:
- the letters are permuted, but not changed, to produce the ciphertext.

# Substitution ciphers
### Shift cipher
lets label the letters as $A=0,B=1,...$
$K$ is the set $\{0,1,...,25\}$
$Enc_k(m)=mod_{25}(k+m)$

the Caesar cipher is a shift cipher with a key $k=3$.
### Affine cipher
now we use two keys $k_1,k_2\in \{0,1,...,25\}$
$$E_{(k_1,k_2)}(m)=mod_{26}(k_1m+k_2)$$
this gives us 312 possible keys
### General substitution
there's a theoretical cap on possible keys of $26!$ for monoalphabetic ciphers. an exhaustive search isn't realistic for such a large set of keys, so it's better to use frequency analysis to find the keys.

Each letter has a unique frequency that depends on the language. If we know that, we can check the frequency of letters in the cipher text and compare to the general letter frequency. E is the most common letter in English, so the most common letter in the ciphertext is probably the encrypted counterpart to E.

for affine substitutions, we use the two most frequent letters to try and set up a system of equations to solve both keys.
