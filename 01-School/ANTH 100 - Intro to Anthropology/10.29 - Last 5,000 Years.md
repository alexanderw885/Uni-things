As said earlier, no consensus on what the word civilization means, but this period of time had the first states, such as Mesopotamia

states have the following characteristics:
- agricultural base
- state level political organization
- monumental architecture
- at least one city
- a form of writing

in states, there tends to be some control over their territories, including either tributes or taxes.. There's an economy based on farming, social classes, public buildings, and some form of record-keeping.

Why might a state collapse:
- ecological catastrophe: climate change, crop disease
- social/political: internal/external conflict, failure of trading networks
- ideological: too many resources on religious activity
Often it's a combination of many reasons
