Evolution is one way to view the world based on science. Other cultures and belief systems may use a different method.

two human-centred examples of evolution
- Lactose tolerance only in certain human populations, and only in humans in general
- different skin colours depending on UV exposure in the environment

### Before Darwin
many different ideas, often based on an "essence", which everything was based on. This was called essentialism.
One view was the Great Chain of Being, where everything was made by God, and the further down the chain, the further from God or perfection. Humans were the most perfect life form, just below angels and God

Linnaeus created the ideas of taxonomy, organising life forms into separate species and categories

### Darwin & Wallace
university educated, wealthy, very upper class.
Wallace was younger, from a lower income family. He did not go to school after 13. 

They worked together, but Darwin is far more remembered.
