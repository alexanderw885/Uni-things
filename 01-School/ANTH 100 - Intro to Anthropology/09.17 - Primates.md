what can studying primates tell us about ourselves?

about 500 species of primates, tarsiers are cool

It's not very useful to compare modern humans or specific people to other primates. There can be uses in finding similaritie\theta_s/differences between humans and other primates, but there are limits that should be put in place, we are very different
- we are not chimpanzees, they are not humans
- humans takes as much as 3 times for their brain to develop than our closest relatives
- our cultures have drastic impacts on our behaviour, more so than the product of our biology
	- sayings like "boys will be boys" encourage this view that biology is the most important factor in behaviour


Most of our development happens in childhood, which is longer for us than any other primate. Most development is affected by culture

# Defining characteristics
eyes on from of head, has stereoscopic vision
generally poor small
large brain
reduced dentition
varied diet, only tarsiers are pure carnivores
- fruits, insects, meats, anything

### Pan genus
Chimpanzees and Bonobos, have many similarities, and share 98% of human DNA with them. Bad metric though, we share 85% with zebra fish

omnivorous
arboreal and terrestrial foragers
walk on knuckles
territorial
about 6/7 million years ago, there was common ancestor between humans and the Pan genus
chimpanzees and bonobos split about 1 million years ago, due to the Congo river
- chimps avid the water, bonobos will wade into shallow water but do not swim

For bonobos, sex is a regular part of socialisation, do not have exclusive partners

# Primates in Crisis
Humans have been destroying primate habitats, and illicitly taking them as pets.
Some have viewed primates as pests, that should be removed. Others see them as food
