Kinship: Interconnected relationships that are built on notions of relatedness. This could be: 
- consanguinity; relations by blood/DNA,
- affinity; relations by marriage
- nurturance: relations by emotional/physical care
Most anthropologists argue that kinship is a cultural construct based on both cultural beliefs and values relating to reproduction, not just one or the other.
Certain parts of kinship are claimed by some to be culturally universal:
- Taking care of babies: in some cultures by one or both parents, sometimes by others
- Some form of marriage exists in nearly every society, but can have many different sets of rules. Not always male/female, not always just between two people
- All societies have gendered labour roles, but they can vary between different societies
- All societies have different rules about incest, though different societies have different definitions.

Lets take a closer look at marriage. throughout different cultures, there's three main characteristics:
- Sexual access between marriage partners, though not always monogamous
- Division of labour and families of orientation (will explain this)
- Support and legitimacy of children, along with property ownership and inheritance

terms relating to marriage:
- Monogamy; marriage between two partners
- Polygamy; marriage between more than two partners
	- polygyny: one husband, multiple wives
	- polyandry: one wife, multiple husbands (less common)
- Bridewealth; transfer of goods/labour from groom's family to the bride
- Dowry; wealth transferred often to either the parent's daughter or her husband at the time of marriage.
