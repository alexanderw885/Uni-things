Big idea: there is as much variation between people in a group as there is between different group. Be careful not to generalise

# Culture
culture is:
- Learned: you are not born with a culture
- Symbolic: things have meaning beyond the literal spoken words or objects. As you understand these more, you can better understand an insider's perspective
- Holistic: absolutely everything is connected, and part of the culture, no matter how unrelated it might be. Economics, science, technology, everything
- Shared: not just one person, always shared in a group of people
- Patterned: even if you don't understand it yet, there are patterns and structures. Nothing is meaningless chaos/noise, there's a code/grammar
- Adaptive: culture changes overtime, both between generations and in the same generation

Culture is how we think, how we feel, what we do
it relates to relations between people, ideas, any everything else

# Ethnocentrism & Cultural Relativism
Ethnocentrism is the idea that your ethnic ways are the correct/best ways. Anyone who does anything different is wrong and/or bad.

Cultural relativism is the opposite idea, that all cultures are important and valid, and can be understood in its own context.
- This means not ignoring our enculturation (changes and influences in our culture), but learning more about it
