In the past, multiple different species of hominids would exist at a time
homo sapiens and neanderthals appeared in middle palaeolithic age, both survived to through the upper palaeolithic age. Neanderthals did not survive past it

Human fossil remains are not only organic material, but any remains in any state. Very few things remain, often only things buried under the ground
the study of what happens to organic remains after death: **Taphonomy**

### What makes us human?
Still a debated subject, once though to be tool use.
- evidence for tool use dates to 3.4 million years ago
Then, once we saw other animals using tool use, we said it was bipedal locomotion that made us unique
- bipedal locomotion
- Other animals such as chimpanzees also can walk on two legs, but they don't exclusively walk on two legs like humans too

Teeth are also identifiable
- Early hominins had large back teeth and thick enamel, but not modern humans

### Hominins
All members of the genus homo, and others that show evidence of bipedalism, such as chimpanzees and bonobos

The precise category is argued over, splitters believe it's a smaller category than lumpers

Secondary traits:
- parabolic dental arcade
- smaller canines
- thicker enamel

### Timeline-ish
- Homo Erectus
	- first out of Africa, travelled to Asia and Europe
	- Hunter-gatherers
- Middle Palaeolithic
	- evidence of finely crafted spears
	- evidence of burials, art, jewellery
	- Extended further north
- Homo heidelbergensis
	- transitional species between H. erectus, H. neanderthalensis, and H. sapiens
- Neanderthals
	- First skull found recognised as non-human
	- better adapted to cold
	- short and strong
	- Thrived during the last ice age, coexisting with H. sapiens, evidence of interbreeding
- Denisovans
	- Discovered in 2008
	- also called H. altai or H. sapiens denisova
	- evidence of interbreeding with Neanderthals
	- DNA found in modern populations in Asia, including Melanesia
- - Homo sapiens
	- high, rounded skulls
	- Also descended from H. heidelbergensis
#### Trends
- move towards bipedalism
- change in skull size/shape
- smaller teeth
- less body hair
- skin pigmentation getting darker, until humans migrated to different environments
