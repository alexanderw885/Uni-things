# Figurines of the Ice Age

Palaeolithic means "Old Stone" age
Neolithic is the "new stone" age

### Upper Paleolithic Peoples
- They're anatomically the same as modern humans
- They were quite healthy, and lived up to about 60. Health only started to drop once agriculture started.
- Nomadic, but there were some locations they would stay in for months at a time, and even return to these sites
- they lived both in caves and on open sites, in huts or tents
- Hunted both large and small animals, gathered plants
- Extensive trade networks with other groups, trading food, items, ideas, and people

The upper paleolithic peoples made a wide variety of items:
- Ceramic figures, but not ceramic pots
- Flutes out of ivory and bones
- intricate pieces of jewellery or ornaments
- Elaborate stone tools made to both be practical and look good. Some tools were even made entirely for decoration, too fragile to be used
- A variety of paintings and cave signs

#### Human Figures
Most figures and art are of animals or geometric shapes, only about 10% that we find are of humans

there's three categories of human figures in paleolithic arts
- Human: we have paintings of hands, engraved images of faces,...
- Humanoids: Some engravings, humanoid masks,...
- Composite Images, half man and half animal
