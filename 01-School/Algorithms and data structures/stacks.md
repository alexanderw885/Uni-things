A stack is a type of [list](01%20Types%20of%20lists.md) that extends arrays or linked lists.

in a stack, you can only take out  the most recently added item (FIFO). It is comparable to a stack of plates, where the first plate is at the bottom, and the last to come out.

operations:
- push(n)
	- O(1), adds n to stack
- pop()
	- O(1), removes top element from stack and returns it
- isEmpty()
	- O(1), returns true if stack is empty
- size()
	- Returns number of items in stack
