# Proposals
## Sylvester and Matt

would you write a solicited/unsolicited or internal/external proposal differently?
clear
could looks more at the audience, sometimes spoke to the screen
covered topic clearly and concisely (followed the seven C's)

# Memos
## Nitin and Jordan
1:54
rushed creation, thought it was happening Tuesday. be more forgiving of you give feedback
very good setup explaining need
good looking to audience 
very thorough on explaining the why, but not as much about the how
didn't cover much tone
a bit long, could be more concise, 18 min
good elaboration on points on slides



# Avoiding "ad-speak" and persuading in professional environment
## Archie, Nahir

a bit  quiet, could speak up more
explained what ad-speak was clearly, and why not to use them
at bit short, 6 min before questions

# How to engage in effective "peer review"
## Kristina, Jonah

clearly describes motive and definition
gave author responsibilities, which I had never thought of
that looks like an improperly introduced list
parts 1 and 2 and 3 could be more concise, a bit shorter
very thorough explanation of reviewer's responsibilities
good, well-explained examples of phrases to use in review
altogether very good points and ideas, very thorough, but each point is overelaborated on
I do like the "Key Takeaways" slide
much too long, 23 minutes before questions





# IEEE citations
## Adam, Luke
1:37
Q: if you site one source continuously for multiple sentences, where do you put the citation?
speaking is clear
could look more at the audience
informative, I will use this info
thorough and clear
good length
good presentation all together!

# Tuckman team model of team development
## Riley, Aymon

1:54
the speaker is very clear
looks out at the audience a lot, good thing
very informative
great length
I really liked the idea of a quiz after going over everything
this was a very good presentation




# How to manage team conflict
## Carter, Brendan
1:48
clear, concise slides
I like the question slides in the middle
maybe slides could have a little more information on them? with the presenters elaborating it's a good presentation, but the slides on their own don't say very much. not much more elaboration needed, but some would be good.

# Collaborative writing
## Marko, Prabhnoor
1:35
could talk a little bit louder
just reading off slides
could benefit from simplifying slides a bit, and just elaborating in the presentation by speaking
at least for intro slides
I do like benefits of collaborative writing slide, very nice
has good points, well explained
I like giving examples of programs to use, good thing to immediately put into practice
I like the visual design overall, but it needs less full paragraphs
maybe try breaking some slides up into a few shorter, more focused slide
goods length

# How to find reputable sources
## Minh, Jagjeevan
1:39
good detail on slides
I like how more info-heavy slides are followed by quick overviews in first-hand sources
going through the example with that class was good
