Lets you write one tests and a list of values, then JUnit will run that test on each of the values in the list.
```java
@ParameterizedTest
@ValueSource(strings={"one","two","three"}
void test(String candidates){
// Test
}
```

Lets' think about `NumberUtils.add()`. It takes two numbers `left`,`right` as a list of numbers. This means it takes 23+42 as `[2,3]` and `[4,2].` It then outputs the list `[6,5]`

The `left` parameter is a list. What possible inputs could we have?
- empty list
- null list
- one digit
- multiple digits
- leading zeroes

All the same possible inputs are the same for the `right` parameter.

They can both be different lengths
- left > right
- left < right
- left = right

What about carry?
- no carry
- carry at the beginning
- carry in the middle
- carry at the end
- many carries not all in a row
- many carries all in a row
- carry creates not most significant digit

That's a lot of tests, we can't combine them all
lets:
- test nulls and empties only once
- test single digits only once
- test multiple digits with and without carries
- test boundary cases
