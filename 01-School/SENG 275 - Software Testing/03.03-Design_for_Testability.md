 to design for testing, it's good to isolate different jobs as much as possible.
 When trying to connect to any other system or database, instead create a port to communicate through to make it easier to test
 Example: online shopping carts
for all paid for carts:
- set status of each cart as ready for delivery, send state to database
- notify delivery center
- notify SAP system
- send email to customer with estimated delivery date
all four of these steps require communication with an outside service. What we need to do is create interfaces to communicate with each server, and then use those interfaces once the cart is paid for. And, of course, implement classes that use the interface for the actual interaction with the services.
Now, you can test each of these interfaces separately, and use mocks in order to test the core functionality
