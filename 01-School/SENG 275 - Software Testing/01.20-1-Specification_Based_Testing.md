7 steps:
1. Understanding the requirement: Figure out what the program should and should not do. Do the specifications tell you how to handle edge cases?
2. Explore the program: Play with it, see if it always does what you expect. Get comfortable with it and what it does. remember this is *not* testing yet
3. Identify the partitions, examine inputs/outputs: good to split into parts
	1. Look at each input, what types are they? What ranges can they be, van numbers be negative? What about null values?
	2. How do these variables interact? Do they depend or constrain each other?
	3. Explore all types of outputs, make sure you test them all
4. Analyze the boundaries: The most common mistakes in computer science are in the boundaries. Identify all the boundaries of each of the partitions you decided on
5. Devise test cases: Now that we have all the possibilities, we can test them. Only test each behaviour once, and don't combine multiple behaviours in one case. It's impossible to check them all, so only test the relevant cases.
6. Automate test cases: write the JUnit test cases. Do we want every single case in a different test, or are there a small number we can group together?
