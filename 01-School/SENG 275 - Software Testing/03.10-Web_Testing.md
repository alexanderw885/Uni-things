part of system testing.
Needs to have:
- usability testing
- cross-browser testing (pc, mobile, firefox, chrome)
- performance testing
- load testing
- security testing
- visual regression testing
For web applications, you need to do unit and integration tests, along with end-to-end/functional tests.
End to end tests will be what we focus on today

What makes web testing different?
Most web applications are distributed across multiple machines, and they only permit access through web browsers
Along with manual testing, we can use:
Selenium: 
- free, open-source, automated platform for testing web applications in different browsers
- Selenium IDE lets you record and then play back tests
- Selenium webdriver is the industry standard, a tool for writing test cases in a programmatic fashion
We'll be using Selenium IDE in this class

setting up tests
```java
@BeforeEach
public void setUp() {
  //chrome
  system.setProperty(
    "webdriver.chrome.driver",
    "<Location of webdriver>");
  browser = new ChromeDriver();

  // If you want to see the window
  browser.manage().window.maximise();
}

@AfterEach
public void cleanUp() {
  browser.quit()
}
```
Testing:
```java
// Good very first test to just ensure the page is loading, and that you have the right page

@Test
public void googlePageLoads() {
	browser.get("https://www.google.com");
	assertEquals(
	  "Google",
	  browser.getTitle());
}
```
