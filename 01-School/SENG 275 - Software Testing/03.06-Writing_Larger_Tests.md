So far, we've been doing unit testing, writing tests for each method we write. These tests are good because they're fast, and easy to both write and control.
Unit testing has problems though, the tests don't reflect real use, and some bugs can't be caught at this level. What can we do to make tests that better reflect reality?
We can test more pieces together. However, this is not easy. Tests get larger, and bugs can be harder to catch.

Lets start by thinking about an integration test, testing the interaction between two components, one of which is outside of your system/architecture. the outside component could be an OS, a database, a webserver...
Let's think about a database. We would want to test:
- that the DB has the right schema
- set up the database state 
- make sure one test does not interfere with another
- clean up database from changes made in the test
We're not just testing the class connecting to the database, you're also testing the database and the interaction between the two.

This was just the integration of two units, can we get an even more realistic test? We can test the whole system with system at once with system testing. These tests are very realistic and they capture the user perspective, but they're slow, hard to write, and can be flaky. sometimes a normally successful test will fail.
