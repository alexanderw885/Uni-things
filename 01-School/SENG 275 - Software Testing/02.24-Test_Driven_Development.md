currently, we implement the code, and then we test it. but the later we test, the harder it can be to debug or fix the program. What if instead, we wrote the test first, and then implemented the program?

1. Think of a test
2. Write the test
3. Implement the behaviour *as simply as possible*
We aren't trying to solve the whole problem at once, we're just implementing the behaviour needed to pass the test each time

Let's look at an example, converting roman numerals to integers.
We might start with the most basic functionality, just converting 'I' into 1
we'll solve this as simply as possible, just hard-coding the value
Then, we'll add more characters, make a program that can read any single roman numeral character.
Next, we add the capability to read multiple characters
Finally, we implement subtractive values (IV,Xi,...)

We will have to refactor the code, possible multiple times, but it's getting better each time.
