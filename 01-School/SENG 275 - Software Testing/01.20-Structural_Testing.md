Along with boundary and specification, if you have access to the source code you can perform structural testing. 

Branch Coverage:
Think of the function like a tree. At every if statement, it branches into two separate paths. Test every different path-branch on the tree for 100% coverage. 

### Mutation testing
now we have structural testing, which designs tests based on the code itself. How can we continue to test the code if it's changed?
Idea: we purposefully insert bugs, and then check if other tests catch them. Mutation testing changes values in the code itself, which then gets run through all the other tests. The goal is for every mutant to fail at least some tests.

Note that not all of these "mutants" are important to catch, you may have do decide which are important and which are not.
