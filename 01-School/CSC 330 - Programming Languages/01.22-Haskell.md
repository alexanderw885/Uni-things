There's a few types of languages
- Imperative (C, Java): Lets programmer state how a computation is done, but not necessarily what is computed
- Declarative languages(functional and logic): Enables the programmer to specify what has to be computed, not necessarily how it's done.
Many modern languages like Python or Rust are a combination of the two.

Haskell is a declarative language, entirely functional.

Haskell was invented in mid-1990s, named after Haskell B. Curry, pioneer of lambda calculus.

We'll be using the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). We can also use the interpreter GHCi in the terminal.

### Functions
```
square :: Integer -> Integer
square n = n * n*
```
This produces a black box. We put in an int, we get out an int.

We could also remove the first line, the signature, and it will try to figure out what you mean.

load file into interpreter:
```
:l filename.hs
:t function_name -- gives types in\out
```
How this class is being taught is by writing functions in a `.hs` file, then loading that into the interpreter to play with.


What are these functions doing?
let's look at an example:
```
double :: Integer -> Integer
double n = 2 * n
```

the line `23 - (double(3+1))`
get simplified `23 - ( 2 * (3+1))`
`23 - (2 * 4)`
`23 - 8`
`15`

### Types
#### Bool
True or False values, uses `&&`, `||`,`not` operators
sample def:
```
exOr :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
exOr x y = (x || y) && not (x && y)
```
Note that it's got 3 booleans in the signature. That shows 2 inputs, one output in this case **The last type is always the return type**. We'll get to that later.

This is a pretty imperative way of doing exclusive OR, but not the only way. We can also use pattern matching.
```
exOr :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
exOr True x = not x
exOr False x = x
```
#### Integer
`Integer` and `Int` are not the same, use `Integer`. 

`Integer` has usual operators, including `div, mod, abs, negate`
 Fibonacci:
```
fib :: Integer -> Integer
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n-2) + fib (n-1)
```
#### Char
characters surrounded by single quotes.

to convert between char and int:
`ord :: Char -> Int`
`chr :: Int -> Char`
There's also `toUpper`, and `isDigit`

#### Float
floating point numbers
Note that `**`is float exponentiation, `^` is integer exponentiation
to convert between float and int: `fromIntegral ceiling, floor, round`
`fromIntegral (floor 5.6)`
___
### Syntax
#### Guards
guards provide alternative definitions for functions. This is *not* pattern matching
```hs
max :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
max x y
  | x >= y    = x
  | otherwise = y
```
it's like an if-else, or chained if statement
```
max x y
  | if(x>=y) = x
  | else     = y
```
watch indentation, it's similar to python

#### Names and operators
- definitions of values must begin with lowercase letter
- types must start with large letter

#### Tuples, lists
tuples:  can have different types, uses`()`
lists: must all be same, uses `[]`
strings: list of `Char`

tuples:
`fst` gives first element
`snd` gives second

Let's look at an example using a tuple:
```haskell
fibStep :: (Integer, Integer) -> (Integer, Integer)
fibStep (u, v) = (v, u+v)

fibPair :: Integer -> (Integer, Integer)
fibPair n
| n==0 = (0, 1)
| otherwise = fibStep (fibPair (n-1))

fastFib :: Integer -> Integer
fastFib = fst . fibPair -- period means “function composition”
```
that `.` in `fastfib` is a function composition. For functions `f`,`g`, and value `x`:
`(f . g) x = f (g x)`
`fst (fibPair x)`

what if we type in 
`fastFib 4`
-> `fst ( fibPair 4)`
-> `fst (fibStep (fibPair 3))`
-> `fst (fibStep (fibStep (fibPair 2)))`
->  `fst (fibStep (fibStep (fibStep (fibPair 1))))`
->  `fst (fibStep (fibStep (fibStep (fibStep (fibPair 0)))))`
->  `fst (fibStep (fibStep (fibStep (fibStep (0, 1)))))`
->  `fst (fibStep (fibStep (fibStep (1, 1))))`
->  `fst (fibStep (fibStep (1, 2))`
->  `fst (fibStep (2, 3))`


Lists:
there are some shortcuts for creating numeric lists
`[1 .. 10]` gives `[1,2,3,...,10]`
`[1,3 .. 11]` gives `[1,3,5,7,9,11]`
these also work with floats, and even 

operations:
- `:` adds to front of list: `3:[2,3] == [3,2,3]`
- `++` is concatenation: `[1,2]++[3,4] == [1,2,3,4]`
	- Note that this is computationally slow
- `!!` returns element index: `[7,8,9]!!2==9`
- `concat` turns list of lists, into a list:
	- `concat [[2,3],[],[4] == [2,3,4]`
- `head` returns first element
	- `head "word" == 'w'`
- `tail` returns all but first element
	- `tail "word" == "ord`
- `take n` returns list of first `n` elements
	- `take 3 "word" == "wor"`
- `zip` combines two lists into a list of tuples
	- `zip [1,2,3] ['a','b','c'] == [(1,'a'),(2,'b'),(3,'c')]`
- `reverse` returns reverse of list
- `length` returns length of list

String operations
show converts non-string into string
`show 5 == "5"`
`show (True || False) == "True"`

read converts string to non-string
`read "3" :: Bool == 3`
**Make sure you specify the type you want**

List Comprehensions:
`ex = [2,4,7]`
`[ 2 * n | n <- ex] == [4,8,14]`
`[ 2 * n | n <- ex, isEven n, n > 3] == [8]`
more generally:
`[f(n) | n <- ex, which values in ex to use]`

full example:
```haskell
addPairs :: [(Integer,Integer)] -> [Integer]  
addPairs pairList = [ m+n | (m, n) <- pairList]  
addPairs [(2,3), (2,1), (7,8)]
```
```haskell
rank = ["A", "K", "Q", "J","10","9","8","7","6","5","4","3","2"]
suits = ["club", "diamond", "heart", "spade"]

deck = [(s,r) | s <- suits, r <- rank]
```

Polymorphism in lists:

sometimes we don't need to worry about what type of list it is. When this is the case, we can substitute type with a variable
```haskell
length :: [a] -> Int
```
`a` isn't a type, it's a stand-in for a type. This is used for list concatenation, for example
`(++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]`

### Local definitions
We can use scope in order to control visibility of definitions.
can use `where` to make "offside rules"
```haskell
sumSquares :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
sumSquares n m
   = sqN + sqM
   where
   sqN = n * n
   sqM = m * m
```
for a fancier example
```haskell
maxsq x y  
 | sqx > sqy = sqx  
 | otherwise = sqy  
  where  
  sqx = sq x  
  sqy = sq y  
  sq :: Integer -> Integer  
  sq z = z*z
```
for an even fancier example, the entirety of quick sort:
```haskell
qsort :: [Integer] -> [Integer]
qsort [] = [] -- empty case throws exception without this
qsort (x:xs) -- x is the head value, xs is everything after the head
= qsort [y | y <- xs, y <=x]
++ [x]
++ [y | y <- xs, y>x]
```

### Lists, Patterns, Recursion
every list can be built from an empty list `[]` with repeated use of `:`. 
Note that `:` is right-associative `x:y:z==x:(y:z)`

remember null/don't cares from earlier? We can use those in lists as well
```haskell
head :: [a] -> a
head (x:_) = x
-- underscore matches tail of list, which we don't care about

tail :: [a] -> [a]
tail (_:xs) = xs
```

There's typical patters of computations/problem solving. Let's look at map, filter, and foldr

```haskell
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]

foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldr f s [] = s
folder f s (x:xs) = f x (foldr f s xs)
```

### Functions as values
```haskell
-- would call as addNum 5 9
-- returns 14
addNum :: Integer -> (Integer ->Integer)
addNum n = addN
   where
   addN m = n + m
```

### Type classes
we've seen "parameterised" functions using `a` or `[a]`, but how do we constrain what `a` could be? We use type classes!

Let's say we need to make sure that `==` is defined for `a`, with whatever that might mean for the class passed in.

```haskell
class Eq a where
   (==) :: a -> a -> Bool
```
Note that `==` is surrounded by parenthesis. This is because we're not actually using the `==` operator, just "referencing" it.
`==` is called a type, it's like an "instance" of a class.
```haskell
instance Eq Bool where
  True == True   = True
  False == False = True
  _ == _         = False
```

### Algabraic types

uses reserved word `data` followed by typename and constructor

```Haskell
data Temp = Cold | Hot
data Season = Sprint| Summer | Autumn | Winter
```
now we can define functions over these types
```haskell
weather :: Season -> Temp
weather Summer = Hot
weather _ = Cold
```

Note that `Cold` or `Summer` are *not* strings, they're values. For a built-in example
```haskell
data Bool = False | True
```
Now, let's make something more complex
```haskell
type Name = String
type Age = Int
data People = Person Name Age
```

### Currying
Functions that act as other functions

```haskell
formatPrice String -> Double -> String
formatPrice currency price == currency ++ show price

formatDollar :: Double -> String
formatDollar = formatPrice "$"

> formatDollar 19.99
=> formatPrice "$" 19.99
=> "$19.99"
```

here, `formatDollar` is currying `formatPrice`, it's taking a double as an argument, and passing it along to `formatPrice` along with a string built into the function.

we can take it another step further
```haskell
formatPriceWithTax (Double -> String) -> Double -> String
formatPriceWithTax formatFn price = formatFn (price * 1.10)
```
