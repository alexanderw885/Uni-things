Nowadays, less focus on HTML pages. Instead, most internet pages are DOMs, or Document Object Models. It represents objects as nodes in a tree, and allows dynamic editing. Also provides access to events on nodes.
We'll use D3 (Data Driven Documents) to interact with them.

Why D3? it's not a graphics library, it's designed for visualising data.
- supports animation
- easy to learn
- while is does rely on scalable vector graphics (SVGs), it's largely based on DOM elements.

SVG: used for two-dimensional images, with support for both interactivity and animation. Often seen in `<svg> ... <\svg>` tags in >HTML

Shapes in SVG:
- `<rect>`: rectangle, has upper-left coordinates, side lengths, and corner radius
- `<circle>`: center coordinates, radius

### Selecting and Binding
D3 manipulates the DOM tree, letting you accomplish three things:
- specify DOM tree location for changes `(select)`
- Associate items from dataset with nodes in the DOM tree `(bind)`
- programmatically modify the appearance of items based on the bound data

Examples are in `CSC330/06-code` directory
#### Select
uses two functions
`d3.select()` selects the *first* objects that matches the criteria
`d3.selectAll()` selects everything that matches the criteria.
These functions can be chained
`d3.select().selectAll()` 
This is evaluated left to right.
#### Binding
can use the `data()` method, it supports the d3 selection method
it will bind the first element in the data to the first in the selection, the second in the data to the second in the selection, and so on
Note: The length of the data does **not** have to match the length of the selection. excess data or nodes will always be at the end of the collection.

Sometimes, we want to modify some data we've already mapped. How can we search through it?

### Getting data into D3
uses standard javascript means to fetch data from a URI. For the most part, we can assume the fetch is a success, but error handling is often important.

Let's say in our directory we have `simple.json`, it has two keys
`{ "val": 5, "txt": "Hello"}`
lets echo it to console
```
d3.json("simple.json")
 .then(res => console.log(res.val, res.txt));
```

`d3.json` is a fetch, so it returns a `promise`. This means it might or might not work. What you need to do when handling a promise is provide two functions, for if it works or if it does not

### Events 
selectors support the `.on()` method
`.on("click", d => console.log(d));`
