Von Neumann architecture - code and data in same memory bank
Harvard architecture - code and data are separated
imperative languages are abstractions of these architectures.

Let's look at variables, they're defined by a number of characteristics, starting with names.

Names have a number of design issues:
- are there reserved words we can't use?
	- a keyword is a special word that can only be used in certain contexts (`for`,`while`,...)
	- reserved word cannot be used as a user-defined name
- how long can the name be, how short should they be?
	- arbitrarily long names can be quite difficult to implement. C99 has no limit, but only the first 63 are significant. C# and Java have no limit.
- What do we do with special/non-alphanumeric characters?
	- PHP enforces that all variable names start with `$`
	- Perl variables start with special characters to denote the variable's type
	- Ruby has `@` for instance variables, `@@` for class variables.
- Are names case sensitive?
	- SQL, BASIC, and Fortran are case insensitive, but this is very uncommon now.
	- case sensitivity is generally a good thing, but it can on occasion lead to typos
Scary stuff.

### Variables
a variable is an abstraction, it refers to a value in memory.
- name: there are cases where variables have names. In that case, there must be some other variables with the address to access it.
- address: location in memory where the address is stored
	- can change at different times in execution
	- may have different address at different places in a program
	- if multiple variables point to the same place in memory, they are called aliases. These can cause issues to readability.
- Type: defines range and operations of values, things like `float`,`char`
- value:
	- l-value: normally a variable's address
	- r-value: the value of the variable
- lifetime and scope
### Binding
Binding: an association between entity and attribute. relation between variable and its type, or between an operation and a symbol
Binding Time, for example, is the moment/time at which the association indicated by the binding is established
different binding times:
- Language-design: binding operator symbols to operation
- Language implementation: binding floating point type to representation, binding size of int
- Compile time: binding variable to type in C or Java, binding operation to symbol in operation overloading
- Load time: bind static variable to memory in C/C++
- Runtime: bind non-static local variable to memory cell

we can largely collapse those 5 different binding times into 2:
- static: binding that occurs before program is executed
- dynamic: binding that occurs once program is executed

#### Type binding
how do we specify the type of a variable, and when does this binding take place?
Explicit declarations: `int var`,`char var2`, when you clearly state the type
Implicit declarations: `var = 5`, `var2='c'`, type is decided through default mechanism, or through naming conventions like in PHP. 

#### Named constants
these improve readability over just using numbers everywhere
making these variables *constants* helps performance at runtime, they get bound at *compile time*
### Data types
#### Primitives
datatypes are called **primitive** if there's no way to break it down further. something like an `int` in c is primitive.
for contrast, everything is an object in Python or R. they do not have any primitives
common primitives:
- `int`: can be different sizes depending on language and architecture. `short`,`long`,`byte`
- `float`: often 32 or 64 bits. `float`,`double`
- `decimal`: mostly for business uses, don't have floating point precision values
- `boolean`: true or false, often stored as bytes for simplicity even though it's possible to do with single bits
- `character`: numeric codings for characters. Often ASCII, more recently UTF-8
- `complex`: some languages including Python support complex numbers

#### Strings
Strings are a sequence of characters. This means the have:
- a beginning character
- an ending character
- any other character has a char both following and preceding it.
Are strings primitive, a type of array, or something else? Different languages have different answers to this, so they may be primitive in some cases?
- C and C++ use `char` arrays
- SNOBOL4, a language made for string manipulation, has strings as primitives
- Fortran has primitive strings
- Python has everything as an object
- Java has strings built in, but not as primitives

Strings may have a static length, determined at compile-time. This happens in C/C++
They may have Limited dynamic length, where they need a runtime descriptor for their length
Last of all, they could have entirely dynamic length, but this is difficult to implement
#### User-Defined Ordinal Types
an ordinal is a type where the range can be easily associated with the set of positive integers (maybe countably infinite??)
Languages let us create our own, called enumeration types, or `enum`.
These `enum` types are mostly to help program readability.

#### Array Types
Arrays are collections of **strictly** homogeneous data elements. having multiple datatypes means the datatype is **not** an array. Each element is called a *subscript*
each element in an array is identified by its distance from the first position.
design questions:
- what types are legal for subscripts?
- do we check if index is in bound?
- when do we allocate space?
- can they be multidimensional, can they be ragged or just rectangular?
- what's the maximum amount of subscripts
- can array objects be initialized?
- do we support slices?

How do we index? In almost all cases, only with indexes. Ada, however, allows you to use an `enum` type to index

When do we bind the subscript type?
- Static: bound at compile-time. This leads to faster runtimes.
- Fixed stack-dynamic: the range is statically bound, but allocation is done at declaration time. this is more space efficient.
- Fixed heap-dynamic: storage binding is dynamic, but fixed after allocation.
- Heap-dynamic: binding of subscript ranges and storage allocation is dynamic, and can be changed during runtime. Most flexible, but hardest to implement
C/C++ lets you choose binding time between static or stack-dynamic with the `static` keyword. They also provide fixed heap-dynamic.
Perl, JavaScript, Python, and Ruby are heap-dynamic.

Multidimensional arrays: some languages support jagged arrays, others just rectangular.
There's two ways to implement multi-dimensional arrays
- Row-major order: each row laid down one after the other in memory. Each row is stored in order, one at a time. This is the most common implementation. 
`[0,0],[0,1][0,2],[1,0],[1,1],...`
- Column-major order: each column is stored in order, one after the other
`[0,0],[1,0],[2,0],[0,1],...`

Modern languages  an actually perform these calculations at compile time, to increase performance at runtime.
The decision of row or column major is determined by the expected typical uses during language development. Modern caches make this far more confusing.

Associative arrays are unordered collections of data elements, where instead of being indexed by integers, they're indexed by some values called keys. They're like dictionaries in python.

a heterogeneous array lets different elements be different types. These might no longer be called arrays, and instead maybe something like `lists`.

a record is a collection of data elements, possible heterogeneous, where each element is identified by unique names, not just numerical indexes. Records are used when a collection of values is heterogeneous. Accessing elements in records is faster than arrays, as more can be determined at compile time.

Tuples are similar to records, but elements are not named. They're immutable, mostly used to allow languages to return multiple values.

Lists are one of the oldest data types. in scheme, has several operations
- `CAR` returns first element of a list
- `CDR` returns all but first element of a list
- `CONS` adds element to head of list
- `LIST` returns list of all given parameters
These are often implemented as linked lists.

Unions are types whose variables can store different types of values at different times of execution. Can be thought of as making a block of memory look like a different type, depending on where it is.
- Free union: no support for type checking
- Discriminated union: AKA algebraic type, has a type indicator 
Unions are unsafe and rarely used. Java doesn't support them, but through sealed interfaces can kind of use them.

#### Pointers and References
Pointer type variables contain an explicit memory address, and a value `nil`, that point to a value in memory.
A reference also point to a value in memory, but you can't directly manipulate a reference.
In C, you can use pointers, store values in pointers, increment them, whatever you want.
In Python, you can get the address of a variable as a reference, but you can't change this reference, or treat it as a value.

When dealing with pointers, you need to deal with some design issues
- What's the scope and lifetime?
- what's lifetime of heap-dynamic variable?
- Are pointers restricted in what type of value they can point to? (Not in C)
- are they for storage management, indirect addressing, or both?
- should the language support pointers, references, or both? (C++ has both)

There are dangers with pointers
- Dangling pointers: a pointer to a heap-dynamic variable that was deallocated
- lost heap-dynamic variable: pointer to heap-dynamic variable is changed, now the variable is no longer accessible but still in memory (memory leak)
