Covers up to the end of the Haskell unit.
### History:
- know names of languages, who made them, problem they were meant to solve

EDSAC: 1949, first stared program computer

FORTRAN (Formula Translation)
- 1957, John Backus
- primarily for science
- loops, functions

Algol 60, 1960
- Peter Naur, John Backus
- for both science and business
- also academic
- very influencial
- refined in 1966
- controversial version in 1968

Pascal
- one pass compiler
- popular for teaching
- Niklaus Wirth

COBOL (common business oriented language)
- separate independent parts
- business use
- not just for programmers

PL/I
- multi purpose, business and science
- combined parts of FORTRAN, COBOL, Algol 60

BASIC
- easy for students
- Thomas Kurtz
- John Kemeny

Lisp
- John McCarthy
- functional

Simula 67
- like Algol 60
- has classes
- ancestor to object-oriented languages
- Kristen Nygaard

C
- B, but with types
- high level assembler
- programming language for unix
- Ken Thompson
- Dennis Ritchie

Modula-2
- data abstraction

Ada
- used by US department of Defence
- Ada Lovelace
- Jean Ichbiah
### Syntax & Semantics
- focus more on syntax and attribute grammars
- types of problems each type of grammar is meant to solve

Backus-Naur form, used to describe Algol 58
- John Backus, Peter Naur
Extended BNF, EBNF
- adds optional parts, in brackets `[]`
- `(+|-)` means choose either
- 0 or more copies in curly brackets

Context-Free Grammars
- Noam Chomsky, 1950s


Attribute Grammars
adds meaning and rulesto CFG
for each symbol $x$, there's a set of attributes $A(x)$
- intrinsic attributes: attributes directly defined for the symbol
- Synthesized attributes: Attributes defined by the attributes of its children
- Inherited attributes: Attributed defined by attributes of its parents

Operational semantics:
- describe meaning of program by executing statements on simulated or real machine
- used for manuals, textbooks, teaching
- natural operational semantics: what is final result?
- structural operational semantics: what steps are taken to get there?

Axiomatic semantics:
- based on formal logic
- set of rules/ expressions called assertions
- used for formal verification
- given condition, how to prove it's correct?
- given loop, how to find exit condition?

Denotational semantics:
- turn everything into mathematical objects and functions
- can prove correctness
