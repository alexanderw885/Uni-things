Domain Name System (DNS) is used to map between IP addresses and human readable "names".

DNS is implemented as a distributed database, a hierarchy of many name servers. 
It's an application-layer protocol. You enter a URL, the browser passes the URL to a local DNS client, which converts it to an IP address and sends it through a [socket](01.14-Application_Layer) with port 53, UDP protocol (Not TCP).

DNS services can do more than just translate hostnames and IP addresses. It can also perform host aliasing. This is when on IP address has multiple different URLs, so the DNS service has to find the original, canonical URL before it can get the IP address.
DNS services also perform load distribution. If many IP addresses all correspond to one name, it can send the request to a less busy server.

Why not centralize DNS to a single server? This would lead to a single point of failure, that could be very far from many users. It wouldn't scale, it would be slow, high-risk, and just a bad idea.

How does it work?

If we want the IP address of a specific URL, we start at the bottom of the tree. we start at the  top level domain (TLD) `.com` or `.org` DNS servers, when then query the Root DNS server.

There are 13 root DNS IP addresses, but thousands of servers. Each server points to the same IP address, but is maintained by a different company. In Vancouver alone, there are 6 root DNS servers.

If a Root DNS server does not know a name, it contacts an authoritative name server to get the name mapping.
An authoritative DNS server is the organization's own DNS server. It provides authoritative hostnames-IP mappings for all names hosted by the organization.

A local DNS name server isn't strictly part of the above shown hierarchy. each internet service provider (ISP) has one. When a request is made, if it stores the mapping locally, it can return the IP address right away. If it doesn't know, then it queries the root DNS server, which sends it to the TLD DNS server, and finally get to the authoritative DNS server to get the mapping.

It could also do a recursive query, though this creates a much heavier load on the upper levels of the hierarchy. This is where the local DNS server queries root, which queries TLD, then authoritative, and finally the result is sent back through each server to get back to local.

### Caching, updating records
Once any name server learns a mapping, it caches it. After some amount of time, it will expire and have to be requested again. This time is called Time To Live (TTL)
If a host changes IP addresses, it may take some time for the whole internet to notice that change, you'd have to wait for all cached mappings to expire

### DNS Records
DNS is a database storing resource records (RR)

Resource Record (RR) format: `(name, value, type, ttl)`
TTL is time too live.

four types:
- A: `name` is hostname, `value` is IP address
- NS: `name` is domain (foo.com), `value` is hostname of its authoritative server.
- CNAME: `name` is alias for 'canonical' name. `value` is canonical name. Example: `www.ibm..com` is an alias for the canonical name, `servereast.backup2.ibm.com`
- MX: `value` is the name of the mailserver associated with `name`.

```python
while true:
	print("")
```

### DNS protocol

You don't have to send just one question, one URL at a time. You can ask for as many as you want in one message, and get all the answers (IP addresses) at once.

while the question is exclusively a URL, an answer consists of both a URL and the IP address.
### Inserting DNS records
to register a name into a DNS registrar, you need to provide two Resource Records: NS, and A. This gives the name, IP address, and authoritative DNS server.
### Attacking DNS
- DDoS attacks: (DNS Denial of Service): bombard server with large amounts of traffic. Hasn't really been successful to date on root servers, but can be quite effective on TLD servers.
- Redirect attacks: Man-in-the-Middle to intercept queries, potentially sending incorrect messages to 'poison' a DNS server, giving it incorrect mappings
