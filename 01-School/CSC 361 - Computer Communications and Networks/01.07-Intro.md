### What is the internet?
network of autonomous networks, with protocols to connect them all. 
There is no single standard architecture for the entire internet.

at the "center" of the internet is a small number of very large, well-connected networks. These might have national or international coverage.
- ex: Sprint, AT&T
these connect to smaller private networks, the content providers.
- ex: google, Facebook


The global ISP connects to the regional ISP, which then connects to home and enterprise networks. How do they all communicate? They follow Internet standards and protocols

### Protocols
A set of rules that two or more peers agree to follow for communication

There's different layers of protocol through the internet, going from the host of the information to the receiver. You don't often directly connect the host and receiver, you instead go layer by layer to the destination. The message 

At application layer, let's say you want to send a message. 
This message is sent to the TCP layer for that machine, which adds a header to the message.
The TCP layer sends the message to the IP layer, which adds its own layer
The IP layer then sends the payload to the linked layer, which adds yet another header to the message.
Finally, the message gets sent to the the physical layer (wifi, internet cables), and sent to the linked layer of the receiving device.

Now at the receiving device, the message proceeds in reverse through all the same layers, before finally arriving at the receiving application layer.

### Connection-oriented vs. connection-less
Connection-oriented means initially following some protocol to establish a connection between two devices.
- TCP protocol
	1. Client sends handshake
	2. Server sends acknowledgement (ACK)
	3. Client sends ACK
	4. Client sends data
An example of a connection-oriented system would be logging in to access a page, first you're sending credentials before looking at the data.

Connectionless means just sending data with no initial communication.
- vancouverUDP protocol
	1. Client sends data
	2. Server responds
An example of a connectionless system is sending an email. No communication is needed beforehand, you can just send the email at any time.

TCP is reliable, but UDP is not. However, this does not means all connection-oriented systems are reliable.
In this case, reliable means that all packets are guaranteed to be received "in order"

### Service Primitives
used by the application layer to send messages

LISTEN
- wait for an incoming connection
CONNECT
- establish connection with waiting peer
RECEIVE
- wait for incoming message
SEND
- send message to waiting peer
DISCONNECT
- end connection

The application layer would send a message using HTTP protocol, which then get converted to the service primitives by an APA to communicate between layers.

### Services Layers, Encapsulation
![[Pasted image 20250108115100.png]]The switch is in your local area network. Whenever you send something outside of your local area network, it goes through a router.

in the router, the network header $H_m$ is swapped for a new one in the network layer. At no point in the network is $H_t$ or $M$ changed, not until it gets to the transport layer of the destination

Side note: When only communicating in local area network, devices only need MAC address. When leaving the local network, the device also needs an IP address.
### Packet switching

packet transmission delay:
- for a packet with a size of L bits, sent at R bps, it takes $L/R$ seconds to transmit the packet 
Store and forward:
- the entire packet must arrive at the router before it can be transmitted to the next link.

What do you do when you receive packets faster then they can be sent? Maybe this is because the router is receiving packets from multiple different devices.
We use packet switching. The packets are put into a queue, FIFO, until the router output catches up with the input. Once the queue in a router exceeds the size of the buffer, any more packets received are lost.

Another option is instead of packet switching, using circuit switching. Instead of forming a queue, the sender will instead reserve the resources to communicate with the receiver uninterrupted. This is not used in the internet, but was used in traditional telephone networks.

Circuit switching is simpler, but packet switching can handle a larger number of users at a time. Let's look at an example
![[Pasted image 20250108121224.png]]
each user takes 100mb/s, and there's 1Gb/s, so 10 users can use it at a time with circuit switching.

With packet switching, we need to make sure no more than 10 users are sending information at a time, and each user is only active 10% of the time. In the real world, we also need to take into account the buffer size in the router for the queue.
In this case, we can accommodate 35 users at a time, with 0.04% chance of over 10 users being active at any time. This is a binomial distribution, p=0.1, n=35.
### Packet delay, packet loss
There's four sources of delay: processing, queuing, transmission, and propagation.
1. Processing: checks for errors, determines output link. Takes maybe some microseconds
2. Queuing: waiting for the output link so it can be transmission. Time depends on the router
3. transmission delay: calculated earlier, packet size / transmission rate, $L/R$.
4. propagation delay: physical length of the link over propagation speed $d/s$.

Once the queue in a router exceeds the size of the buffer, any more packets received are lost.
Once a packet is lost, it might be sent again by the previous node, or might might not.
