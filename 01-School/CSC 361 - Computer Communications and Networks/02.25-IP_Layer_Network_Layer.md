at this point we have out packet to send, now we need to get the packet to its destination. 
The network layer is notable in that every single router or device should have it, even if they don't have an application or transport layer.

The network layer has two main functions:
- forwarding: moving packets from a router's output to an appropriate router's input
- routing: determining the most efficient path to the destination.
Note that the router only knows it's local network, it does not know exactly where the destination is, just its address.
#### Network layer service model: Best effort
best effort is very simple, easy to implement
provisioning of bandwidth allows real-time applications such as video streaming to usually work
best effort can **not** guarantee:
- successful delivery of data to destination
- timing or order of delivery
- bandwidth available to end-end flow

### Side note: ICMP
Internet Control Message Protocol handles error reporting, and router signaling.
### IP
IP datagram format: 
![[Pasted image 20250226113444.png]]
some fields are self-explanatory, some are not,
- head len: length of *just* the header. Needed because the options are variable length
- length: length of header *and* payload
- time to live: number of routers the packet can go through. Every router reduces the time-to-live by one, and once it reaches zero, it's dropped.
Graphical bug on the right of the image: destination IP is always 32 bits/4 bytes, and the entire packet is at most 64kb, usually 1500 bytes
### IP addressing
**Important section!!!**
each IP address is 32-bit, one is associated with each host/router interface.
An interface is a connection between host/router and physical link. Hosts tend to have one interface, while a router might have multiple interfaces, one for input and one for output. Ethernet/wireless would also create different interfaces.
#### Subnets
a subnet is a set of devices that can all communicate directly without passing through a router.
IP addresses throughout a subnet will all share the first three bytes, they only differ for the last bytes.
a subnet mask (/24) is used to get just the first 24 bits, to identify a subnet.

Note that as shown in this image, interfaces create subnets even if there's no other devices
#### CIDR
Classless InterDomain Routing ("cider")
Allows the subnet portion of an address to be arbitrarily long.
uses format `a.b.c.d/x`, where `x` is the number of bits in the subnet portion `a.b.c.d`
for example, `123.456.789.012/8` would mean the subnet portion is 8 bits, or the whole subnet shares just the `123` in the address.

If there's the ever case where the destination address has multiple possible matches, choose  the option with the *longest matching prefix*.
### DHCP
How do we get an IP address? This has two parts
1. how does the host get an IP address within its network?
2. How does a network get an IP address for itself?
the first part is decided using DHCP, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. 
DHCP has 3 main functions
- renew its lease on an address in use
- allow reuse of addresses when they're no longer being used
- support mobile users joining and leaving the network
4 messages are sent in the protocol:
1. host broadcasts DHCP discover message: This is sent to everyone in the subnet, as the host doesn't know the DHCP server address
2. DHCP server responds with DHCP offer: Does not contain the IP address, just confirms the DHCP server's address. As the host device does not have an IP address, it's also broadcast to everyone
3. host requests IP address with DHCP request: message contains an IP address the host is asking to use
4. DHCP sends address with DHCP ack: Does not contain an IP address, just confirms the host can use what they suggested.

the first two messages can be skipped if the host already knows the address of the DHCP server.
All messages are broadcast to everyone. This help DNS servers keep track of where devices are.

the DHCP server is often co-located in the router, serving all subnets the router is attached to.
### Network Address Translation (NAT)
