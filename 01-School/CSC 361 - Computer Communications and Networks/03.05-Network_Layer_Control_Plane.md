Nowadays, we separate the network layer into the "data plane" and the "control plane". In the previous notes, we covered the data plane. The data plane in in charge of forwarding packets, while the control plane is in charge of routing, determining the route to take from source to destination

There's two approaches to routing:
- per-router control: each router independently decides where each packet needs to go next, based on the final destination
- logically centralised control: router determines where each packet should go based on a pre-calculated forwarding tables made by a remote controller
