Nowadays, we separate the network layer into the "data plane" and the "control plane". In the previous notes, we covered the data plane. The data plane in in charge of forwarding packets, while the control plane is in charge of routing, determining the route to take from source to destination
### Routing Protocols
There's two approaches to routing:
- per-router control: each router independently decides where each packet needs to go next, based on the final destination
- logically centralised control: router determines where each packet should go based on a pre-calculated forwarding tables made by a remote controller

The Routing Protocol determines "good" paths from start to end, where good could mean any number of things:
- fastest
- least congested
- least "cost" (could be a literal monetary cost)
how might we define cost, in general?
- view the internet as a graph, where vertices are routers, connected routers have an edge between them.  each edge has a cost, and it may have a different cost in each direction. This can be solved with Dijkstra's algorithm
- There's also the much simpler recursive algorithm, the Bellman-Ford algorithm:
	- let $D_x(y)$ be the least-cost path from $x$ to $y$
	- let $c_{x,v}$ be the cost of the edge from $x$ to $v$
	- $D_x(y)=min_v\{c_{x,v}+D_v(y)\}$
When the cost of an edge changes, the connected nodes recalculate their $D_v$ value, then notify neighbours. This updating repeats, cascading through the network.
### Intra-ISP routing
for scalable routing, group together routers into regions called "autonomous systems" (AS)
for intra-AS routing, it's routing all in the same AS. all routers use the same protocol, and any router at the "edge" has connections to routers in other As'es. these routers on the edge are "gateway routers".
for inter-AS routing, the gateway router has to perform both inter and intra AS routing.

There's multiple protocols for intra-AS routing:
#### Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
Each router sends OSPF link-state advertisements to all routers in the AS. We We then calculate the path of least cost, as shown above. Each router has information on the entire AS, they don't all need to communicate to determine cost.

### Inter-connected ASes
routing through different ASes uses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
It lets a subnet share it exists, where it is, and who it can reach.
- obtaining reachability from neighbouring ASes is eBGP
- propagating this reachability to all internal AS routers is iBGP.

if a router finds multiple inter-AS paths to a destination AS, it will take the one with the lowest *intra*-AS cost. This is Hot Potato Routing
### Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)

used by hosts and routers to communicate information on the network-level, mostly for pings and errors. a message includes the type, the code, and the first 8 bytes of the IP datagram causing the error
