### Sockets
A process will send and receive messages through its sockets. It connects the application layer and the transport layer.
Each socket is identified by two things:
- IP address
- port number: identifies which application the message belongs to. Let's say the browser wants to send an email. The browser will send its IP address as well as HTTP request port number to the socket. The email client will also send a message through it's email socket, sending the port number for SMTP.
	- default port number for HTTP request: 80
	- HTTPS: 443
	- FTP: 21
	- SMTP: 25
You can think of a socket as a function with IP and port number as inputs, that sends information to the next layer.

### Web and HTTP
a webpage consists of objects, which can be stored on web servers. These objects could be HTML files, Images, audio files, other webpages,...
Each page consists of a base HTML file, which includes referenced objects. Each object is addressable by a URL (Uniform Resource Locator).
# HTTP
HyperText Transfer Protocol is an application layer protocol for the web.
The client requests, receives, and displays web objects using the HTTP protocol
The server sends objects using the HTTP protocol in response to requests.

Process:
1. Client initiates TCP connection to server, port 80
2. Server accepts connection
3. client browser and web server exchange HTTP messages
4. Connection is closed
By itself, HTTP is stateless. It does net keep any information about past requests. Cookies are used to get around this.

##### Client Side
Browser runs as single process, that's onnly designed for HTTP protocol. They then interface with plugins in the browser to allow for things such as audio, pdf-viewing, or things like ad-blockers. They also may use helper processes.
This is all in the client machine.
##### Server side
Servers must be much more powerful than user machines.
They have a front end that takes all requests and send all replies. Once a request is received, it connects to one of its many processing modules, which might then connect to a cache. The processor then sends the requested data back to the front end, which then send the outgoing reply to the client.
For a large server, instead of just having multiple processor threads in one machine, it would have a single front end connected to many separate processing machines connected to a local network. 
As servers get even larger, the front end won't be able to keep up. To reduce front end load, each processor will send the response directly to the client. However, this would cause issues since the processor has a different IP address than the client expects. To get around this, the processor performs "IP spoofing", and sends the response with the front end IP address.

##### Types of HTTP connections
there's two types:
- Non-persistent: the TCP connection automatically closes after sending at most one object
![[Pasted image 20250114121652.png]]
- Persistent: The TCP connection can sent multiple objects over a single connection before being closed. The client will decide whether to keep the connection or close it, and sends the corresponding signal in each HTTP request.

RTT is the time for a packet to travel to the server, and back to the client. For non-persistent HTTP, each object takes 2 RTT. To make this faster, they would often open multiple TCP connections in parallel.
For persistent HTTP, after the connection is established, it only takes 1 RTT per object, 1 RTT to establish the connection, and 1 RTT to request the list of objects.

### Types of HTTP Messages
There's two main types of message: request, and response
#### Request
The request is in ASCII, it's human-readable.
first line is the request line, has commands like GET, POST, or HEAD, which are then followed by the URL.
The next lines are header lines. These have info such as:
- the host/server
- the user/browser the requester is using
- what type of response is accepted (file type)
- what language (English,French)
- what type of encoding to use
- should the connection be terminated or not

Types of request messages

- POST method: user input sent to the server, often from things such as web forms
- GET method: includes user data in the URL field, requests data from the client
- HEAD method: requests only the headers that would be returned if the URL was requested with GET. Used for testing
- PUT: uploads object to the server. If a file already exists at the specified URL, that file is replaced.
### Response
The response contains 3 sections; the status line, the header lines, and the body.

status line (HTTP/1.1 200 OK)
- HTTP version
- Status code
- status message
	- 200 OK: request succeeded
	- 301 Moved Permanently: new location specified in message
	- 400 Bad Request: message not understood
	- 401 Not Found: document not on server
	- 505 HTTP Version not supported
Header lines:
- field: status of field
Then, it contains the body of the response

### User/Server state: Cookies
HTTP GET/response is stateless. There's no multi-stop transactions, and all HTTP requests are independent of each other.
Cookies are a way to get around this. They're sent from server to client, and then for each following request the client sends cookies back to the server.

### Web Caches (proxy servers)
To reduce the load on the server, a browser might instead send requests to a local web cache. There's two possible cases
- Object is in the cache: the web cache returns the object
- Object is not in the cache: the web cache requests the object from the server, then sends it to the client.
Not only does this reduce server load, since the cache is likely physically closer to the client it reduces travel time.

Caching objects has the side effect that a client might not get the most up-to-date version. While this might not matter in some cases, some websites want to stay up-to-date. Whenever a cache requests an object, the server has two controls in the response header
```
Cache-Control: max-age=<seconds>
Cache-Control: no-cache
```

### HTTP2
HTTP 1.1 would have multiple, pipelined GET requests over a single TCP connection. It's first-come-first-serve, small objects may have to wait for large objects. Re-transmitting lost objects also stalls transmission.

HTTP 2 tried to decrease delay in these scenarios. Now, instead of FCFS, there can be object priority to follow in sending order. Objects can also be divided into smaller frames, to reduce blocking. 
Altogether this means that instead of waiting for a large object to send, this large object will be divided up into smaller objects, and other smaller objects will have priority.

HTTP 3 adds more security, will be covered later.
