Pseudorandomness is a relaxation of true randomness. It's a property of distributions. Let's thoroughly define it

let's consider just strings of length $\ell$. The distribution $\mathcal{D}$ is pseudorandom if it's indistinguishable from the uniform distribution on strings of length $\ell$.
What if they're not all the same length?
We need to consider an ensemble $\mathcal{D}=\{\mathcal{D}_n\}$ of distributions, where $n$ is a security parameter. In this case, $\mathcal{D}_n$ is a distribution on strings with length $\ell=n$.

What does it mean to be indistinguishable from the uniform distribution? It means that any feasible adversary, given a sample from either $\mathcal{D}$ or uniform distributions, has a negligible chance of telling which distribution it came from.

a *distinguisher* is a PPT algorithm $D:\{0,1\}*\rightarrow\{0,1\}$

Another way of saying that $\mathcal{D}$ is pseudorandom is to say that $\mathcal{D}\approx\mathcal{U}$.

The whole reason we've been doing this is because while the 1-time pad is good, the key must be as long as the plaintext.
What if we used a small key, and a pseudorandom generator PRG to extend it to a longer string for our one-time pad?

### Pseudorandom generators PRGs

PRGs are deterministic. They take a short, truly-random seed as input, and return a pseudorandom string.
$n$ is the seed length, and $\ell(n)$ is the seed length. Let's look at the case where $\ell(n)=n^k$ for some $k.$ 

let $G$ be a poly-time algorithm that takes input $s\in\{0,1\}^n$ and outputs string of length $\ell(n)$.
$G$ is a pseudorandom generator if:
- for all sufficiently large $n$, $\ell(n)\gt{}n$
- for every PPT distinguisher $D$:$$|P(D(r)=1)-P(D(G(s))=1|\leq{}negl(n)|$$ Where $r,s$ are randomly uniform.

$\ell$ is the expansion factor, or stretch factor.

### fixed-length encryption scheme with PRG
 $G$: PRG with expansion factor of $\ell$.
 $\Pi_G$=<Gen,Enc,Dec> as:
 Gen: on input $1^n$, choose $k$ uniformly at random from $\{0,1\}^n
 Enc: on input $k\in\{0,1\}^n$ and $m\in\{0,1\}^n$, output:$$c:=G(k)\oplus{}m$$
