given a graph G, and a subset of its vertices S
a vertex cut is the collection of all edges that have one endpoint in the subset S, and the other outside the subset S

Given a graph $G(V,E)$ and a subset of vertices $S<=V$, an $(S,T)$-cut where $T = V-S$ is the collection of all edges with one endpoint in $T$ and one endpoint in $S$
