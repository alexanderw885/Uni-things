a linked list is a type of [list](01%20Types%20of%20lists.md) made of nodes, each with a payload and a [[pointer]]. the linked list starts with a "head", that points to the next node, and so on, until the last node, the "Tail", which points to a null pointer.

you only have access to the head and sometimes the tail directly, for all other nodes you have to traverse through the linked list.
