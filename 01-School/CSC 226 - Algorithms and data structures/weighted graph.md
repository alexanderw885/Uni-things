Weighted graphs are a type of [list](01%20Types%20of%20lists.md), and a subcategory of [[graphs]].

in a weighted graph, each edge has a numerical weight

The weight of a tree is the sum of the weights of all edges

### Notation
given a graph $G(V, R)$ 
 - V = vertices
 - E = edges

Weighted Graph: $W\in\mathbb{R}$
