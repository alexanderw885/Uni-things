Arrays are a type of [list](01%20Types%20of%20lists.md)

Array length is declared at creation, allocating a block of memory to be used. To go to any index in an array, you start with the [[pointer]] at index 0 and add the index\*size of the element the array is made of
since arrays are made for single data types, this puts the pointer at the first bit of any index in O(1) time.
