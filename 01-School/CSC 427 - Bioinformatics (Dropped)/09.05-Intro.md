- Reading DNA is a messy process, with errors
- DNA is a *very* large amount of data. How do we store and process it?
- What can we learn from it?
These are questions for bioinformatics / computational biology

The data is messy, the algorithms and processes are messy, our understanding is messy. We don't know what's going on, and we have an overwhelming amount of data. 
### Key problems:
- **Classification**: determine species composition of population of organisms
- **Assembly**: establish nucleotide composition
- **Sequencing**: identify mutations/variations in genomes in a species
- **Quantification**: Using DNA to measure the functional characteristics of a cell (figure out what the cell does/how well it does it)
