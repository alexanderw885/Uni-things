AKA Dummy classifiers. Used to compare against prediction models to see how good they actually are.

There's a few different strategies, each with two methods:
`predict()`: pass in a sample, it predicts the class
`predict_proba()` pass in a sample, it returns the probability that this sample is any class
#### most_frequent
`predict()` returns most frequent class
`predict_proba()` returns probability of 1 for most frequent class, 0 for the other classes
#### prior
`predict()` returns most frequent in training set, just like most_frequent
`predict_proba()` returns class distribution of the training set
#### stratified
`predict()` returns random class, with the probability distribution being the distribution of classes in the training set
#### uniform
`predict()` returns random class in the training set with the same probability for each class
`predict_proba()` returns the same value for all classes, $1/n$ for $n$ classes.
#### constant
`predict()` returns some class label chosen by the user
`predict_proba()` returns 1 for the given class, 0 for all the others
