Very big data sets, how do you analyse it?

Data mining has 2 primary types of tasks
- Predictive tasks: use attributes to predict unknown or future values
	- Classification, Regression
- Descriptive tasks: find human-understandable patterns to describe/understand data
	- Association Discovery, Clustering
# Nomenclature
training set, testing set, validation set:
- training set is a set of data where we know all values, used to train new models.
- Testing set is used to check performance of models.
- validation set is used for adjusting parameters
training instances, training examples
- values in training set
labelled instances
- 
attribute, feature, variable
- interchangeable, columns in a table
class variable, target attribute
- interchangeable, feature we're trying to predict
classification
- when target attribute is categorical
regression
- when target attribute is numerical

models
- shape of prediction, linear/non-linear type of thing

# Tools that will be used
â€¢ Python ecosystem  
- Numpy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn
# Predictive Data Mining
Given a training set of known attributes and classes, learn a model to predict the class based on attributes
#### Fraud Detection
Collect transaction data
label each transaction as fraud or fair
train a model to classify transactions

Use this to detect fraud in new transactions

#### Direct Marketing
use data from similar product launches
collect data on people 
train a classifier to predict likely adopters

use this to choose who to advertise new products to
# Finding Associations
### Market-based Model
large set of items (things sold in market)
large set of baskets (things one customer buys in a day)

the baskets and items are in a many-many relation

the goal is to find what items are likely to go in the same basket
#### online purchases
if the baskets are customers
and the items are things bought online
- try to learn what items are bought together

if the baskets are things bought, and
the items are the customers
- search for similar customers
#### Words and documents
is the basket is a sentence
and items are words
- see what words appear together to suggest linked concepts

if basket is sentences
and items are documents containing sentences
- items that appear in the same baskets may represent plagiarism

## Clustering
given a set of points, clusters represent data points that are very similar to each other, but different from data in other clusters
#### Document Clustering
group similar documents together based on keywords

represent each document as a vector, built based on the keywords
use distances between these vectors to find clusters
