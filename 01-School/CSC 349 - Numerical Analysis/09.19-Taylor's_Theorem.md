to calculate $f(x)$ at $x$, near value $a$:
$$f(x)\approx{}f(a)+f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2+...+\frac{f^{n}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n+R_n$$
first term is just the value at $a$
Then we give it the first derivative at $a$
then we give it the second derivative at $a$
...
up to $n$ derivatives just at a.

$R_n$ is the error
$$R_n=\frac{f^{n+1}\xi}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n-1}$$
$$x\leq\xi\leq{}a$$


As an example, $e^x$:
$$e^x\approx1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{9}+...+\frac{x^n}{n!}$$
Other important methods for approximation:
- instead of calculating the derivative at a point, calculate rise/run using that point and a nearby point
- Instead of integrating a function, you can use then rectangles to approximate area
