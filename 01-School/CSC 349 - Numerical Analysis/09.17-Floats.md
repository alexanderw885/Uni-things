### Arithmetic
we can use fl to denote floating point arithmetic: $fl(a+b)$
We'll *always* need to specify our precision

**Idealized floating point arithmetic**
perform exact arithmetic, then either round or chop to $k$ significant digits.
When we have multiple operations, break it into smaller $fl$ operations
$$fl(x + y \cdot{} z)=fl(x+fl(y\cdot{}z))$$
W'll be using this throughout these notes for the following reasons
- behaves very similar to actual float arithmetic
- much easier to do by hand
- nearly identical accuracy to real float arithmetic

Example:
$x=0.1234\cdot10^0$
$y=-0.5508\cdot10^{-4}$
$k=4$

actual value for $x + y$
$0.1234+(-0.00005508)=0.12334492$ 

round to get $fl(x+y)$
$fl(x+y)=0.1233$

calculate the relative error
$$\frac{|0.12334492-0.1233|}{0.12334492}$$
$$=\frac{0.00004492}{0.12334492}$$
$$\approx0.00036$$

### Subtractive cancellation
When we subtract two nearly equal floating point values, we lose significant digits, much more so compared to any other standard operation
