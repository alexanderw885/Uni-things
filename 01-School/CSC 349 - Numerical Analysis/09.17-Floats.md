### Arithmetic
we can use fl to denote floating point arithmetic: $fl(a+b)$
We'll *always* need to specify our precision

**Idealized floating point arithmetic**
perform exact arithmetic, then either round or chop to $k$ significant digits.
When we have multiple operations, break it into smaller $fl$ operations
$$fl(x + y \cdot{} z)=fl(x+fl(y\cdot{}z))$$
W'll be using this throughout these notes for the following reasons
- behaves very similar to actual float arithmetic
- much easier to do by hand
- nearly identical accuracy to real float arithmetic

Example:
$x=0.1234\cdot10^0$
$y=-0.5508\cdot10^{-4}$
$k=4$

actual value for $x + y$
$0.1234+(-0.00005508)=0.12334492$ 

round to get $fl(x+y)$
$fl(x+y)=0.1233$

calculate the relative error
$$\frac{|0.12334492-0.1233|}{0.12334492}$$
$$=\frac{0.00004492}{0.12334492}$$
$$\approx0.00036$$

### Subtractive cancellation
When we subtract two nearly equal floating point values, we lose significant digits, much more so compared to any other standard operation.
Let's look at $\sqrt{x^2+1}-x$, with $x=65.43$ and $k=4$.

$fl(x^2)=4281=0.4281\cdot10^4$
$fl(x^2+1)=4282=0.4282\cdot10^4$
$fl(\sqrt{x^2+1})=65.44=0.6544\cdot10^2$
$fl(\sqrt{x^2+1}-x)=0.01=0.1000\cdot10^{-1}$
but the real value is  $0.0076...$, this error is huge, $0.31$

We very strongly want to avoid this. Here's a trick to get around at least some cases.
Let's say we have $a+b$.
$(a-b)\frac{a+b}{a+b}$ can lead to a better result.

Using the Taylor expansion for trig functions can also give better results. They still use subtraction, but not between two numbers at the same scale.

Trig identities can also help to avoid subtraction.

There's no one trick to use, each case needs to be evaluated individually
