For very simple uses, we can just design a finite state machine. For something so simple, it's often cheapest to buy an existing general-purpose microcontroller, even though it's far faster than needed.
CPU design for a general-purpose processor (GPP):

What happens when a good enough existing GPP doesn't exist?
They won't design a whole new GPP from scratch, and it's too much work to design a whole new processor from scratch. Instead, they'll augment an existing GPP. This could be in the form of a second processor, different memory, peripherals, changing the ALU, and more.
In this class, we'll mostly talk about augmenting a GPP with standard peripherals

**Book on the subject:** Superscalar Microprocessors Design, William M. Johnson

Once a GPP is augmented for a specialized task, it becomes an Application-Specific Instruction-set Computer (ASIP)

How do we choose our processor?
As mentioned before, there's size, speed, and cost, but that's not all, and how do we even measure speed? instructions per second could be good, but some instructions are more complex than others. a benchmark is a good way to get statistics on performance, we can use those. Just be careful to interpret the results properly
 Another important aspect of our decision is the architecture, the instruction set.
### Advanced RISC Machine (ARM)
specifications:
- 3-stage or 5-stage pipeline
- 32-bit words
- 32-bit address bytes
- each address refers to a byte, so the PC increments by 4 on each instruction
- 16 registers R0-R15
- R15 is the program counter
- Current Program Status register:
	- bit 31 - N - set when result is negative
	- bit 30 - Z - set when result is zero
	- bit 29 - C - set when there's a carry
	- bit 28 - O - set when operation results in overflow
- ARM does not have an instruction for divide
- uses 2's compliment to represent integers
	- Be careful with bit shifting right for dividing by 2. sign extension may be needed

For this course, we'll use `gcc 4.3.2` as our compiler. there is a compiler provided in the VM.

Predicates instead of branches: we can add conditionals like `LT, GE, EQ` after any instruction.
`BRLE` means branch if less or equals
`ADDEQ` means add if equal flag is set

using predicates avoids jumps, improving pipelining, and certain bitwise operations are faster. However, it complicates hardware and takes more space in memory
