Let's say we want to implement a task, say, Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) on an arm device, but the device isn't fast enough.
We want to extend the instruction set by adding more hardware, and we want to decide the following question: Should this new computing unit be:
- an augmentation, a finite automata
- combinational circuit, built from logic gates

This new hardware would be added alongside the ALU, as shown here:

side note: What if we don't have any opcodes left? If every opcode is used, we would need to extend the opcode field by one bit, which will slow down the machine. More realistically, you'd want to disable a pre-existing opcode

### Processor Taxonomy
Combinational logic gates with no loops, no feedback. It's entirely linear. Since every input can be matched to a specific output, we can say it exhibits "autonomous behavior".  **Zeroth order processor**

Sequential gates have loops, or feedback. Now, depending on the feedback, the same output might give different responses, so it's no longer autonomous **First order processor**
We want to minimize the number of operators and gate
These are very fast, but very single-purpose. They can be hard to change or repurpose

Automata are **Second order processors**. You cannot program them, but they have states, they have feedback

Microprocessors are **Third order processors**. They're programmable RISC devices, like ARM. As of this order, we no longer have to redesign the hardware to change the purpose of a device.
At this level, we tend to write *firmware* instead of *software*.

Processors are **Fourth order**. They're fully programmable CISC devices, such as general purpose computers.

At this level, we don't tend to have control over the firmware in the micro control automaton, only the software.
### Architecture
C: counter
R: Register

CROM: control automaton
- C - address generator for a ROM
- ROM - stores program
RALU: execution automaton
- R - stores ALU inputs and outputs
- ALU - performs computation

In the past, memory was very slow, so they optimized memory reads as much as possible. They would read once for a complex instruction, which they would then break down into many small instructions. This means they used CISC devices
Now, as memory is faster, allowing for simpler instructions, creating RISC. RISC assembly is much easier to read, and it's easier to optimize RISC code and compilers.

#### Microcode
Vertical: One instruction at a time
Horizontal: Multiple instructions at once. Horizontal devices are  known as Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) architecture.

Linear microcode: No logic flow control, no branches or anything

That's very limiting, what would it look like if we had an unconditional jump?

You can see the memory can now send addresses back to the multiplexer at the top, giving the new memory to the counter.

This is still limiting, what if we want conditional jumps?
