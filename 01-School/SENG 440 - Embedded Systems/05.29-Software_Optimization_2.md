### Writing loops
Reduce the memory footprint of loops
	if you know your for loop will run less than 100 times, use a short int, or a `__uint8_t` to save memory. Be careful about overflow though.
	**Watch out**, if your compiler only uses 32-bit arithmetic instead of 16, it's performing a check on every loop to check if it should overflow.
	Maybe just leave this as an int unless you know for sure your processor supports 8 or 16 bit operations

**What's the best way to write a loop?**
 What's the best way to initialize the counter to 0? In assembly, there's usually a "move immediate" instruction, 
 `MOV r0, #0`. This is a very fast instruction, so we want to make sure it gets used. Some processors have a register always weird to 0, so you can just move that to the desired location.
if you don't have `MOV` you can also use `i ^=i` (XOR) or `i_-i`. These arithmetic operations, if the processor has them, are also 1 cycle. The downside is that they will set the zero flag

For our exit condition, should we increment and compare to some value `N`, or should we decrement and compare to 0?
It depends on if it's a comparison to a constant or a variable, but in general is is faster to start at N, and decrement and compare to zero. This is because decrementing can set the 0 flag, so the check only takes one cycle.
### Memory Aliasing
Memory aliasing occurs when two instructions can access the same memory location. This generates dependencies, reducing parallelism. Modern compilers perform memory disambiguation, or alias analysis in order to rearrange instructions to increase parallelism.
The can, on occasion, try to remove aliasing where there isn't any, slowing down the program. We can prevent this with pragmas
`int* restrict a;` promises that no other pointer will access a's memory.
another pragma is `no_alias`
```c
convolution(int* a, int* b, int* c)
#pragma no_alias *a, *b, *c;
{
	// convolution function here ... 
}
```
you can also check what compilation flags you can use, there may be some that impact aliasing
### Cache Access Optimization
if we know cache organization, we can increase the cache hit rate.
- if accessing the entirety of a 2d array, depending on if the array is [row-order or column-order](02.07-Names-Bindings_Scopes_Datatypes), you should access it in order of memory. Otherwise, you'll have for more cache misses
### Misc Optimizations
clearing an array of bytes
	is it a multiple of four? If so, erase 4 at a time by declaring them as ints.
	No compiler can tell if an array length is a multiple of 4, checking will have to be your job
Unaligned pointers
	The above, type casting, is an example of an unaligned pointer. Some architectures don't support unaligned pointers. There's compilation options to check (alignment trap checking)
	What if they don't support unaligned pointers? 
	We can force it using unions

Signed or unsigned ints?
	no difference in performance for addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
	division by multiples of two is slightly faster with unsigned ints, since signed ints using 2's complement need to be incremented first.
Switch cases
	if you have a large switch statement, put the most likely cases at the top. This improves average time, but not the worst-case time. Instead, use a lookup table. But, this may increase the average time.
Register spilling
	when we run out of registers, they will store data into memory. We can't impact this very much, but we can use the register keyword to *ask* the compiler to keep data in a register
	`register char a;`
