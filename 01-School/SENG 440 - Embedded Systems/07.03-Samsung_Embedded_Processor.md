### ARM vs Thumb
- Arm: 32-bit, word aligned
- Thumb: 16-bit, half-word aligned
- ARM is faster, better for speed-critical routines
- Thumb is slower, takes less space, good for non-critical routines
- Some registers are *not* accessible in thumb mode. To save space in instructions, register addresses are shorter so they can't all be called
- no predicate operations in Thumb mode
