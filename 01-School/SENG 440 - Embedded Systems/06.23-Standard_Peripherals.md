Standard peripherals are single-purpose devices, each for a specific input/output task. Things like timers, counter, digital-analogue converters.
The cost of these peripherals are often low, and the devices them selves are reliable. However, as now we're implementing a whole new single-purpose device, the resulting design we're making may not be optimal

### Timers and Counters
A timer measures intervals by counting pulses from the clock
A counter counts pulses from some general input.

**Definitions**
- Resolution: small detectable incremental change of an input
- Accuracy: maximum difference between actual value, and output of instrument 
Note that while accuracy and resolution are independent, accuracy can never be better than the resolution.

**Timers and counters have intrinsic error of two bits**.
let the clock period be 10 nanoseconds
- The resolution of the timer is 1 clock period, 10 nanoseconds
- The accuracy is $\pm$ one clock period
after just 5 nanoseconds, the timer will say either 0 or 10 nanoseconds. Same after just 1 nanosecond, the timer will say 0 or 1.

### Digital to Analogue Converters (DAC)
also Analogue to Digital converters (ADC) 
Converting analogue values to binary, and vice-versa
For this class, we'll assume we have 10-bit binary values, and analogue voltages from 0-10V
Full-scale values (FS) are the highest possible values. This mean the digital FS is $2^{10}$, and the analogue FS is 10.
the resolution is
FS-analogue/FS-digital = 10 / 2^10 =9.54mV

#### Errors
There are some errors to be aware of in a DAC:
- quantization error
	Just like with the timers earlier, $\pm$ the resolution. It can never be removed, only reduced.
- Offset error
	Does the converter start at 0? Offset error is difference between the lowest possible output and the converter's output for the lowest possible input
- Full-scale error
	What is the error between the actual and ideal transfer function at full-scale? (at maximum voltage). Just like offset error, but at the other end.
- Gain error
	How well the slope of the real transfer function matches the ideal transfer function. Error may increase as voltage increases. This can change due to temperature changes, and can be corrected for in both software and hardware

- Integral nonlinearity error (INL)
	The real transfer function may not be a perfectly straight line as shown above. INL is the deviation from this straight line.
- Differential nonlinearity error (DNL)
	Ideally, two analogue input levels that trigger two successive outputs should only differ by one bit, the least significant bit.
	DNL is any deviation from this. Maybe the converter goes straight from `0100` to `0110`.
	A DNL less than or equal to 1 means no missing codes.
- Drift error

Offset, full-scale, and gain errors are relatively simple to be corrected in software with simple arithmetic, or even in hardware.
INL can  be somewhat compensated for with a lookup table.
DNL is much more difficult to compensate for, and should be considered case-by-case.
#### Measurement systems - organization
A transducer converts from one type of energy to another:
- Thermoelectric: temperature to electrical signal
- Electroacoustic: pressure changes to electrical signal
- Photoelectric: light levels to electrical signal

All of these transducers have their own errors! Any type of gain or offset error can be corrected with simple arithmetic, and non-linear errors can be corrected with a lookup table.

#### Example
we want to measure temperature from 0-100 degrees, with a thermoresistor. It's a linear device, but it's often used in a "resistance bridge" to make it easier to check the resistance, but this will respond non-linearly to temperature. Altogether, this is the equation:

We can compensate for every linear error, reducing it to this:

Now, we can either use a lookup table or calculate the inverse function to compensate for the non-linear error
### Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter (UARTs)
data is written into UART port and transmitted serially. It's then received serially and read into the host processor.
- 5-8 bits of information
- parity bit
- 2 bits for start/stop

Two ways to measure transmission rate:
- Bit rate: bits per second
- Baud rate: signal changes per second
bit rate = (# of information bits) \*(baud rate)

what if we don't have $2^n$ symbols, but some other number? we'd round up to the next power of 2
