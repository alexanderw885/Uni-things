briefly mentioned in [CSC330](02.01-Midterm_1_Review).
Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer in the 19th century. She's considered the first programmer.
ADA is a general purpose programming language with a focus on reliability. Due to this reliability, it is used for military applications.

large ideas:
- promote good practices
- detects as many errors as possible at compile time
- write portable programs
- easily encode concurrency
- easily capture exceptions

We can have subprograms in the form of procedures and integers.
- Procedures take both inputs and outputs as arguments, and can return multiple values
	`procedure P( X : in Integer; Y : out Integer; Z : in out Integer)
	X is an argument in
	Y is an output
	Z is both an in and an out argument
- Functions take only inputs, and only returns one value.

Misc notes:
- Pointers do exist, but pointer arithmetic does not.
- Strong, static typing
- no implicit type conversion, must be explicit. Even if you make two types with the exact same definition, you cannot use implicit conversion.
