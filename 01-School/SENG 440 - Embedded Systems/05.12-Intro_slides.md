### What is an embedded system?
It's hard to define, but it's a computing device that isn't a general purpose computer or supercomputer.
It's programmable, but not general-purpose. They're designed and optimized for a small number of pre-defined tasks.
They do have a number of common characteristics:
- single-function
- reactive, real-time
- programmable (not often to users)
- tightly constrained
- low power, size, and cost.

Data-level parallelism is typically, though not always supported on hardware. It also can support pipelining.
on our ARM device, we'll have parallelism on 8 and 16 bit element vectors.

### Design process
formalism is needed. To comply with the very strict requirements placed upon the embedded system, the designer needs to know exactly what they need it to do, and what they have access to.

- **Non-Recurring Engineering Cost**: cost of designing the system
- **Time to Market**: time required to develop the system to release.
- **Performance, Flexibility**: It's a trade-off between the two, the more flexible a device the slower the performance. Performance is measured as a measure of latency (time to start execution) and throughput (number of tasks completed in a unit of time
- **Power Consumption**: specialized units have a lower number of instructions, so lower power overhead.

Firmware is executable code stored within ROM. While it's not always true, software for embedded systems is often called firmware.
