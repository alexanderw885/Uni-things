### Representation


Signed-magnitude:
	one bit is the sign, the rest of the bits are the magnitude. 1 is negative
Complement representation:
	we can represent the negative value $-x$ as $M-x$, where $M$ is called the *complementation constant*. This constant depends on if we're using 1's complement or 2's complement

Rounding:
	add binary 0.1 to the number, then discard the fractional part. adding binary 0.1 is equivalent to adding decimal 0.5

**How to avoid overflow**
addition and subtraction with N bits returns N+1 bits
Multiplication with N bits returns 2N bits

### Addition and subtraction
Let's say we've got 16 bits per integer. We can go up to $2^{15}.$ What do we do if we have overflow?
- Wrap-around addition: return a negative value on overflow
- Saturation addition: return the largest possible value, even if it's not the answer.
Which option we choose depends on our use case. Often, the default is wrap-around so we need to tell the compiler what we want.
- `armcc` compiler has the assembly instruction `QADD`, saturation addition. We can use it in C with `__qadd()` `gcc` doesn't support this, you'll have to use assembly inlining.

Subtraction works the same way. The assembly instruction for saturating subtraction is `QSUB`.

### Multiplication
if we multiply two 16-bit signed values, we have 15 bits for magnitude. This means we get a 30-bit magnitude and 1-bit sign. What do we do with the extra 32nd bit?
- Replicate the sign bit. 
- add a zero as the least significant bit
Either way, there's a bit that isn't carrying any information,  so you can do either option. **However**, make sure you know what's happening, and that the option you choose won't have implications in future operations.

**Edge case**
Remember that you can represent larger negative numbers compared to positive. You might have the range $[-2^{15},2^{15}-1]$. If we multiply $-2^{15}*-2^{15}$, we get an overflow.To avoid this, we need to use saturating addition `QADD`.

What do we do if we want fractional multiplication in a system that doesn't have it? We'll need to emulate it with integer multiplication:

### Example
space = velocity * time
$s=vt$
let's use 16-bit precision.
max $v$ = 331.5 m/s
max $t$ = 3600 seconds

#### velocity
our scale factor is the smallest power of two that's greater than the max value. $2^{9}$ is the smallest value greater than 331.5.
To convert our real values into fixed point, we multiply the real value by our scale factor, and round to the nearest integer.
#### time
our scale factor is the smallest power of two that's greater than the max value. $2^{12}$ is the smallest value greater than 3600.
To convert our real values into fixed point, we multiply the real value by our scale factor, and round to the nearest integer.

#### Space
Space will be a 31-bit value. it's max value is 331.5\*3600=1193400
the smallest power of two that's greater than this value is $2^{21}$, which you can also get by multiplying the scale factors of time and velocity.

### Q format notation
Q notation is used to imply position of a binary point.
Qm.n format:
- m is the number of bits in the integer part of the number
- n is the number of bits in the fractional part of the number.
