# Mann-Whitney Test, a Nonparametric Two Sample Procedure

In a two-sample setting, where the data isn't paired, the Mann-Whitney test is a non-parametric alternative to the t-test without any assumptions. This test again uses the idea of replacing the actual data values with their ranks, like the signed-rank test

we group both samples together, ranking all $m+n$ samples. Our test statistic $T_Y$ is then the sum of all ranks from the first sample

Under the null hypothesis that both samples are from the same distribution, it's equally likely that either sample will have larger ranks assigned to it.

each of the $_{m+n}C_m$ assignments of ranks to the $y$ sample is equally likely, with probability $(_{m+n}C_m)^{-1}$
