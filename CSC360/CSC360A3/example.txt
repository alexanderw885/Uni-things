I need a big file, so I'm gonna copy/paste
  
A good thing to do to make programs faster. One of the **Most important** parts of this course. To use Dynamic programming, the problem must have the following attributes

### Memoization

If a "sub-problem" is reused at anytime, compute it only once and store the result (memorize it)
Solve the small problems first, then solve the large problem after.
for this to work, the problem must have the following properties:

#### No Cyclic Dependencies
Subproblems must have an order, **cannot** by cyclic

#### Optimal substructure property
Optimal solutions to subproblems can be combined to get an optimal solution to the original problem

### Overview of steps to do
by using the following steps, one can create a dynamic algorithm
