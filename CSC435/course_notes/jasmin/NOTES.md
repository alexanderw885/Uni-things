A few things
---

Probably the best thing to do is create an alias (or some kind of
link) in your environment such as `jasmin` becomes the same as `java
-jar (PATH_TO_JASMIN)/jasmin.jar`.

For example, if `jasmin.jar` is in `/home/babayaga/jasmin` then
something like this in Unix/macOS would serve the purpose:
```
alias jasmin='java -jar /home/babayaga/jasmin/jasmin.jar'
```
